\begin_layout Title
Diary - Part Ten-C
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
January 2025 – present
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepštas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Unlike parts one through nine in this series, this one is not really about
 the language-learning effort.
 It is instead a private diary; a continuation of Part Ten-B, which got
 over-long.
 It is not curated for human consumption; I am making the assumption that
 no human being will ever actually read this.
 Thus, its filled with random stuff I feel like writing.
 Some of it is very personal, some of it is nonsense.
 Mostly, I am finding that the act of writing helps otherwise vague and
 scattered thoughts quantum-collapse into a more coherent form, where I
 can examine them, like a dead butterfly pinned down in a display case.
 Dead words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Human readers are discouraged from reading this, on the grounds that there
 are probably better uses of your time, than to sync your thought-patterns
 onto mine own.
 Live your life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part Ten already got an introduction.
 How many more do you want?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
29 December 2024
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's a good time to start afresh.
 In short – dafuq am I doing? I seem to be going at max RPM in first gear.
 Is this supposed to be fun? I'm burning out writing the Atomese sensori-motor
 code.
 In the previous diary entry, I convinced myself that this was not a totally
 stupid idea.
 Now, I am not so sure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the early visions for Atomese was to create affordances suitable
 for algorithmic boostrapping.
 This is a nice vision, but perhaps a mistake – and on multiple levels,
 a mistake.
 Perhaps I got lost in the details.
 The details are a vision of computing from 100 years ago: that lambda calculus
 can say anything sayable.
 Updated to more modern time, we find that lambda calculs is the internal
 language of Cartesian Closed Categories.
 These are big words, and the bigness of them is beguiling, and I think
 lie at the heart of the mistake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thanks to my physics/math background, it was very natural for me to dive
 deeply into the microscopic details of structural atoms.
 Perhaps one of my finest acheivements is coming to an understanding that
 jigsaw pieces are perhaps an ideal structural element.
 Jigsaw can be used to build anything.
 They are more naturally expressive than lambdas, and have natural identificatio
n with tensors (and the many-world parallelisms of tensors).
 Making them ideal for Bayesian priors, and other many-choice settings.
 They have natural interpretation as graphs.
 But they're typed, and so carry significant information (having significant
 information content.) And I didn't invent them.
 Many other have invented and reinvented them, over the decades.
 So, all around goodness.
 So why am I crying? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, if the goal is to build AGI ...
 well, if jigsaws are like atoms (like literally, cehmical atoms) I'm daydreamin
g of creating biology from them.
 Well, that's nuts: biomolecules have millios of atoms (daltons, or whatever).
 I'm not gonna get there.
 I might discover some cute low-level assemblies.
 But that's it.
 Not scalable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, second example.
 It's like day-dreaming of building a computer from individual transistors.
 Of course, this has been done, but it took decades and tens of thousands
 of engineers.
 There's pretty much exactly zero infrastructure for working with jigsaws.
 Like just about none at all.
 So I'm at square one.
 No one is interested, no one is helping.
 Basically, it won't happen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, third example.
 It's like day-dreaming of building a neural net out of individual neurons.
 Oh wait ...
 well, again, this has happened.
 Again, this took decades and tens of thousands of academics, grad students,
 engineers, tinkerers of all kinds.
 So, yes, neural nets all start with a single sum and a single sigmoid,
 but the scaling is the result of a massive engineering effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I think jigsaws are as promising as any of these things, as a basic, basal,
 low-level self-assembling structural component.
 Its just that ...
 I'm at square one, and no one shares my vision.
 So its not going anywhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What to do? Well, the lesson to be taken from LLM's or, perhaps, Microsoft
 Copilot, is that the world is filled with human affordances.
 At this stage, in the early 21st century, it is easier to build neural
 nets that can work with the available human affordances, such as coding
 in java or python or whatever, than it is to create this assembly-like
 intermediate language I call 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Atomese
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Atomese was meant to make it esy for machines.
 But it starts at such a low level, that leveraging up seems single-handedly
 impossible.
 Just teach the computer to code in python, and be done with it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hah.
 And there's the rub.
 Current state of the art in neural nets suggests that they'll never be
 able to arrive at the abstractions needed for doing the kind of reification
 that humans natrually do.
 So licking back and waiting for AI to magically learn how to program seems
 ...
 well, it renders me into an observer, rather than participant.
 I'd rather participate, for now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So what can I grasp at, what can I do, to be effective? Well, I've got several
 more visions.
 I articulated them on the opencog wiki in the last few days, and also in
 a readme file somewhere.
 But again – they're visions, and from what I can tell, visions shared by
 no one, so I'm like – roll up your sleeves, and get to work, you dog.
 This leads to a feeling of hopelessness.
 I burn out from going max RPM in first gear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What should I do instead? When I ask this question explicitly, I rapidly
 get to the general perception of well, I can rattle off all the social,
 psychological, cultural, political, economic activities that humans engage
 in, and they are so varied.
 Somehow, being a medical doctor is worthier than sitting around doing cross-wor
ds all day.
 or being a junkie.
 Western culture got that part right.
 But perhaps medical doctors burn out: there's always one more patient to
 treat.
 So, me here: there's always one more technical paper to read, one more
 line of code to write.
 Max RPM in first gear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current Western-civ definition of shifting into higher gear is to garner
 money, power, fame, influence.
 Gaining any of those takes effort and talent, and like any human activities,
 take decades to hone one's skills.
 And as that is done, I read less papers.
 Perhaps this should be like atheltics: don't overtrain one muscle group,
 while leaving others atrophied? I've let my power, fame, money and influence
 atrophy.
 And now here I am, wimpering like the old man that I am, that my ethereal
 being hurts.
 The physical therapist suggests some simple exercises for the weak and
 dibilitated: pay the bills, read the email.
 Like any ordinary person recuperating frome an injury, taking the doctors
 advice is hard.
 I don't want to go out and exercise, to go out and exercise and gain the
 strength so I can go to the olympics of wealth, fame and power.
 Unh, unh.
 Cause people do what they want to do, and I am a person.
 Perhaps whats-hisname from Star Wars could say

, but well, dafuq.
 I can force myself to ride a bike up that hill in Southern Walnut Creek
 bike trail.
 I can force myself to do what it takes to win gold medals at the US masters
 nationals.
 I do NOT have to force myself to read textbooks on general relativity or
 string theory, because I find that actuall fun.
 I do have to force myself to pay the blls and read the emails, cause that's
 not fun.
 Or something.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I feel like I am procrastinating.
 And, well, I am.
 Because the duties that I shirk do not provide the dopamine reward that
 I've grown accustomed to.
 I'm a goddamn dope addict, addicted to reading math textbooks, instead
 of doing whatever the fuck I should be doing.
 Crap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Worse: I engage in activities without asessing the worthiness of those activites.
 Like I spent a month hacking on the 25th anniversary edition of Bigfoot.
 (the i370 code base.) Its useless, cause no one but no one except maybe
 Paul Edwards, and even then that;s a maybe ...
 no one will ever use it and no one will ever care.
 I might as well have spent the month doing crossword puzzles, or mainlining
 heroin, or something.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was one minor utility: in the back of my mind, I got to review the
 landscape of operating system technology, from assemblers and compilers
 to kernels, and file systems and containers.
 It lead to my playing with Ceph, so now I've got my home cloud.
 And its interesting to see how Ceph is multi-machine autonomous in a way
 that single-machine OS'es are not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which brings me back to where I started: my current path of tinkering with
 Atomese is not going to recreate Ceph in my lifetime.
 So I'm torn.
 One part of me rests completely assured that million-dimensional vectors
 of jigsaws are absolutely the correct approach.
 Another part of me is repelled by the daunting task of taking the next
 steps.
 Or mis-steps, as they may be.
 A third part of me laments my wasted youth.
 A fourth part of me is more than happy to also waste my waning years.
 A fifth part of me is deluded into thinking that perhaps by verbalizing
 into this diary, something will happen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But is 10PM Sunday night, and I'm tired.
 I think I will go do something relaxing.
 I think I will got read more of David Tong's Cosmology.
 It's a nice treatment.
 I'd never really seen a decent treatment of FLRW before.
 It's not super-complex; the lectures are aimed at undergrads.
 But they're focused, concise, clear, well-written.
 Unlike a lot of crap I read.
 Why can't people write? I wonder if I can write.
 I think I can, but no one reads what i write, so maybe my topics, my style,
 the things I have to say just aren't, well, they're just not Kardashian
 enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With that, good night, adieu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*

\begin_layout Standard
The Big Think.
 Somehow, for decades, longer, since college, before, I've avoided actually
 thinking about the 
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

big question
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: what is AGI, really? I'm going to avoid it a bit more, with a few paragraphs
 of autobiography.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I remember the first time I built something.
 I stacked two blocks, one on top of another, and they didn't fall down.
 I got to three even, but could not move past that.
 Mother had gone shopping, I guess, and left my sister and I in the basement.
 The basement was kind of a safe space: nothing there, no way to escape,
 nothing to break, no way to get hurt, warm.
 I must have been four.
 My sister is a year and a half younger, I think she was sitting, crawling.
 I tried to show her how amazing it is to stack blocks, but she seemed disintere
sted.
 I think I even got her to stack two.
 No more.
 Actually, I think I got maybe five high.
 There were arch components, and a big trangular block, for a Roman forum
 look.
 I might have stacked two columns, and put that on top.
 See, I don't clearly remember that any more, I remember the thrill of getting
 to three, and once that was mastered, the rest was down-hill.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I remember what the basement looked like.
 Grey enamel floor.
 Stairs in the center, no railings.
 Work-bench to one side, open space to the other, and then the furnace room.
 I could draw a plan, right now; I remember it photographically.
 Well, I did spend a lot of time down there.
 79th and Justine, Chicago, Illinois.
 I remember a lot of that interior.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I remember the day I learned to read.
 Fox in Sox.
 Doctor Suess.
 Mom had a record of that, vinyl LP.
 She put it on.
 Somewhere in the middle, I realized that the words I was hearing correlated
 with the symbols aka words on the page.
 Put it on again, from the beginning.
 Sure enough! The first 3,6,9,12 words correlate perfectly! The first two
 or three pages are similar, having similar arrangements of words, but subtly
 different, and from those subtle differences, I could tell that the spoken
 words started on page one, and not on page two or three.
 That they were in order, and not backwards order, or jumbled.
 The were perfectly synced, and started at the begining.
 I got so busy verifying the correlations on the first three pages, that
 I lost track on page four.
 No matter.
 Start it again.
 Yes, they correlation between sound and words persists through page five.
 I form a hypothesis: I bet it works that way, to the end of the book (which
 seems impossibly long, but there we go...) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I remember explicitly formulating this hypothesis.
 Of making this prediction.
 Prediction is the wrong word.
 Nor was it an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a ha
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 moment.
 I mean it was, but more like, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gee, I bet this goes on to the end
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Not betting with money, but more concretely: if I were to listen to the
 sounds again, they would match the words.
 The ability to listen to sounds again was unquestionable, a subconscious
 given, not available for analysis.
 Ditto the looking at the pages of the book.
 These were not topics of awareness.
 What was in the awareness was that if the actions were repeated, the correlatio
ns would persist.
 Perhaps inference is the right word.
 Prediction is the act of seeing something (visually) and knowing what will
 happen next (in time).
 But this correlation was not in time or space, it was abstract.
 Thus, I was not predicting anything.
 Rather, I made the inference that the sounds and the words are corellated.
 On the third or fourth listen I got maybe ten pages in, to the part

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I got tangled up in there.
 I think my Mom didn't want to listen to it one more time, so that was it
 for the day.
 I got to finish the book, and eventually memorize it, over the next week.
 But that was it, that is how I learned to read.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A very conscious process, with explicit conscious formulation of hypothesis.
 Starting with a dawning awareness of correlations, the game was on: a sleuthing
, a analyszing a detective mystery: if we go back, and play the record again,
 then the words wer correlate, and they will do so exactly, and not just
 in some impressionistic form, but precisely.
 All this was in my conscious awareness: that it could have been merely
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

close and suggestive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and my hypothesis was that, no, it would not be just 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

suggestive of
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but that it would be exact.
 I was very concerned with lacunae.
 What if the spoken word skipped over pages? I paid attention to flipping
 the age: that the sounds, the spoken words, would correlate with what was
 non the next page, not skipping a word or two, not sliding in some syllables
 that preserved the beat and rhyme, but failed to actually correlate with
 what was printed on the page.
 All this was in my explicit conscious awareness.
 You, dear reader, might think I am confabulating, but I am not.
 This is what my memory functions recorded of the incident.
 They recorded the process of awning awareness, the inference, the hypothesis
 formulation, the explicit formulation of multiple competing hypothesis
 (that the correlation was poor, inexact, skipped over words...) the surmise,
 surmission, that the correlation would be exact.
 The hope that it would be exact.
 Lurking in the back was even a sense of disappointment: if the spoken words
 failed to correlate with the text, I would be disappointed.
 A grand insight would be dashed.
 Reality would be random and vague and blurry.
 I wanted it to be sharp.
 I hoped it would be sharp.
 This is the emotional side.
 My memories do a poor job of recording emotions, but in this case, I know
 for sure that it would have been a disappointment, if the words didn't
 correlate, and that this sleuthing adventure would be quickly abandoned,
 and forgotten, if this was not the case.
 I had better things to do with my time, than to listen to some artistic
 impressionistic verbal recital that vaguely dealt with the same topics
 as the written book.
 I mean, that was fun and OK-ish, but definitely weak sauce.
 I could do something else.
 Like maybe wander into the living room, or something.
 There were lots of other interesting things to do.
 Crawl under the table, or something.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, I remember the floor plan.
 Visually.
 The radio, Blaupunkt.
 The record-player, in a cabinet above, a cabinet my father had made as
 a college design project.
 We still have it.
 It's up in the attic now.
 The aluminum legs are not quite strong enough to bear the weight.
 Its modern.
 It looks like a Mondrian painting, but furniture.
 Three open bays, a fourth bay with a black formica door.
 But I wander off-topic.
 Of course, everyone remembers many things, for may different reasons, in
 many different ways, in all sorts of different abstraction settings, with
 different kinds of focus on what was important, and what wasn't.
 Some people are ruled emotionally much more; others are analytic.
 I suppose I have to class myself on the analytic side.
 But I'm also normal.
 I'm good with the visual arts.
 I like music, I could play guitar.
 I like sports.
 Socializing with other people is my weak spot; I don't do much of this.
 i think my parents are partly responsible.
 They knew I was smart, and they very much did not want me to hang out with
 other kids, or, at least, other kids who were not Lithuanian.
 SO I got Audrius as a good friend.
 Audrius was not a genius.
 But I digress; this is not meant to be about my childhood, but about AGI.
 So, lets get back on track.
 and that means more autobiography, before I tackle AGI head-on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My aunt taught me how to read.
 Aunt Irena.
 When my parents visited, she gave me and my sister some Donald Duck comic
 books to look over.
 She had quite the collection.
 (She also had first editions of Ancient Greek poetry, Sophocles, or something
 like that.
 She loved to read.
 I have a photo of here, knee-deep in Lake Michigan, with two other friends,
 holding a book up.
 In water, With friends.
 Books don't go into lakes, with water and friends.
 But this is my Aunt Irena.
 So...) Anyway, so my uncle walks in, and catches us red-handed: we are merely
 looking at the pictures, and not actually reading the text.
 And it is clarified that at least I know how to read.
 My sister, maybe not quite yet.
 Unclear.
 But me, I can read, and my uncle is demanding in that way: you will submit
 a book report.
 You will read this, and next time I see you, you will submit a book report.
 This is the kind of threatening demands he would make.
 Take fun things and turn them into not-fun.
 My aunt intervenes, I think.
 She's much more gentle.
 She says, don't grill them.
 Never mind him.
 It's OK.
 But you really should read the words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And they're right.
 When you read the words to a Donald Duck comic book, the story really has
 nothing at all to do with what you imagined it was about.
 It's completely and totally different.
 The words and the pictures kind of fail to correlate entirely.
 The pictures tell one story, but the words tell a quite different one.
 The pictures are only there for illustration, decoration.
 They loosely, impressionistically illustrate important events in the written
 text, but only loosely.
 This comes as a mixture of disappointment and surprise, and an acknowledgment
 of defeat.
 My defense to my uncle was that I already knew what the story was, because
 I could tell, by looking at the pictures.
 I didn't have to read no god-damned words.
 I didn't swear, of course, I didn't know any swear words.
 But emotionally, it was like that.
 Fuck the words, I don't need no stinkin words.
 I can tell what's happening from the pictures, and goddamned pedants like
 you want me to fucking suffer and read fucking words for something that's
 already obvious from the pictures.
 This is what went through my mind.
 Fuck this shit.
 Words.
 Screw that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And yet, I sort of had to acknowledge that the story plot, as told by the
 pictures, was pretty friggin blurry and vague.
 I spent a *lot* of time decoding those pictures, trying to figure out what
 the story was, and failing.
 The panels in a Donald Duck comic book DO NOT TELL A STORY.
 Disney sucked, in that way.
 He could illustrate, but he could not make his illustrations talk.
 They were mute snapshots.
 He had to fucking fall back onto words to get the point across, and those
 words really for the most part had almost nothing at all to do with any
 implied plot-line you could extract from the pictures.
 This is what I was thinking.
 This is how I thought.
 Well, I wasn't directly critical of Disney, not yet, because I hadn't yet
 discovered this non-correlation.
 But I did read one or two or maybe three comic books that day, and I do
 have to say that Disney wrecked the magic.
 There was magic in the pictures, and the words fucking wrecked it.
 I mean, the words were fun, and I do have to say that the plot lines were
 far, far more complex and sophisticated than what the pictures told.
 So, if you could gain satisfaction from reading words, then I guess that's
 an OK thing, but it came at the cost of ruining the pleasure and enjoyment
 of looking at the pictures.
 So, yeah, Disney sucked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I mean, I read a few more comic books in the years to come, but it was never
 actually fun.
 It was a pass-time.
 It was an OK way to spend some time, but it was not something I looked
 forward to, not something were I'd think, wow, now I get to do this, can't
 wait! Disney ruined comics.
 I wonder if this is an issue with Disney, and other artists don't have
 this problem, or what.
 But I think this stuff is invisible to adults.
 Some adult somewhere would have to take active, conscious effort to do
 better.
 Well, look, maybe its like one of those New Yorker

 contests.
 See, what Disney should have done was to draw the pictures first, and then
 given them to someone else, to come up with a story and plot.
 But I think he was an illustrator.
 He wrote the words, first, and then just illustrated.
 I have no clue if he was conscious of this.
 If he was aware of this, and did this intentionally.
 I'm thinking he didn't.
 He thought he was creating something fun, imagined that he was creating
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

magic kingdoms
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but I can personally attest that it was the opposite.
 He destroyed magic.
 There was magic in the pictures, and the text fucking destroyed the magic.
 And the swear word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

fucking destroyed
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 is really what it felt like, when I was 5 or 6 years old, at my uncles
 house (apartment, actually.

\begin_layout Standard
If you don't believe me, just go to the Magic Kingdoms in Florida or California.
 There's damned little, no magic in them.
 They're mostly flat, boring, stupid and meaningless.
 I don't understand what the fuck people see in those places.
 They're just dumb.
 Fuck that.
 No adventure.
 Want to have adventure? Go to fucking Paris.
 Don't go to the fake-Paris cafe in Disneyland.
 But I digress.

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, one digression that might be worthwhile, because it explores the world
 of somatic feelings.
 So, as an adult, working for IBM, I'm sent to SIGGRAPH in Florida.
 I book a hotel in Disneyland.
 The Woodlands lodge, when it was brand new.
 Construction completed just weeks earlier.
 I have a late flight in, evening.
 Flying sucks.
 I actually planned to come a day early, to poke around, so took an evening
 flight so that I would not miss too much work.
 And its a long drive from the airport to Disney.
 Stand in a rental car line, all that hassle.
 And its hot, and its muggy, its Florida in the summertime.
 And I refuse to run the A/C in the car, on the grounds of some kind of
 principle, or something.
 So, I'm overdressed, hot muggy, wind-blown from driving wth the windows
 rolled down.
 Tried, vague headache.
 Lugging a heavy suitcase that hurts my hands and arms and back to lift,
 hurts my legs to walk and stand straight after sitting in a car for hours.
 Exhaustion.
 And I walk into the lobby of the Woodlands Hotel.
 And its cold.
 Checkin counter.
 I mean, cold.
 But refreshingly cold.
 And there's a scent of burning pine.
 And as I'm at the counter, waiting for my room key, I'm already being transport
ed to Northern Wisconsin.
 A chill in the air, a mild aroma of pine wafting through the air.
 And its very relaxing.
 After that drive in the Florida humidity, its the perfect antidote.
 And its subtle and its gentle and its refreshing, and it feels good.
 It hits the spot.
 Now this, this is Disney magic.
 This really worked.
 This is what it took, what it feels like.
 Ah.

Well, the wonderful doesn't come until I start looking around the lobby.
 OMG.
 Its a cavernous Canadian, Seattle woodlands lodge.
 There is a two story-tall fireplace in the corner, with a roaring fire.
 To heat the place, because its frankly a bit chilly.
 And it is obviously the source of that burning pine smell.
 And the absurdity of it all is not lost on me: I know, I am aware that
 it is like 95 and humid outside, and its like 65 and dry and piney inside,
 so they've got the A/C cranked, and they are using an open fireplace to
 heat the place.
 Which is how it's done when you're in the Canadian woods on a cool evening,
 and in Canada (or Northern Wisconsin), *all* evenings are cool.
 And I'm looking around, and the whole place is decorated in Cowboys and
 Indians shibboleth.
 Boy-scout knives and axes.
 Drawings of teepees.
 And its luxury.
 So one thing that catches my eye is the floor is half marble, and half
 carpet, and these intermingle along curvy lines, streams.
 Not straight, but meandering.
 And I'm think 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

that's pretty classy, right there That.
 This is luxury
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I mean, the two-story fireplace in the corner, OK.
 But the attention to details, the floor of marble and carpet, that was
 something.
 And you know what? Those curvy lines lead to somewhere.
 There is a small stream in the floor.
 There is a small river-stream in the floor.
 It starts at the end of the lobby.
 You won't find it if you don't explore.
 It's not there to hit you over the head, its subtle and off to one side.
 But it is definitely water, and it definitely is flowing, and its a stream,
 a woodlands stream.
 Like in Wisconsin.
 But its late and its time to go to my room, and I've got these boyscout
 themes percolating all through, coloring my emotions and perceptions and
 visually smack in your face, because like someone took my Boy Scouts of
 America Handbook, and literally copied pictures from it onto the walls
 of this hotel.
 And that is how I go to bed, go to sleep.
 Transported to a wonderland.
 So, yes, Disney is magic.
 Done right, its magic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I did go there, maybe a decade later.
 It was run down.
 Too many grimy kids scratching the paint off the walls, and puking onto
 the carpet and sticking their grubby little hands into the woodlands stream.
 And I think the fireplace was turned off.
 But that was daytime, maybe they run the fireplace only at night.
 I dunno.
 Magic spells work only once.
 You can't go back there again.
 This is the tragedy of being caught here and now, with your memories.
 There is no time-travel.
 There is no rewind button.
 Careful, Linas, lest your memories turn back to physics.
 I finished Tong's Lecture 2 on Cosmology: Hot Universe, last night.
 I like it.
 Pleasant reading.

Back on track: so my Aunt feeds me sci-fi.
 I remember the first short story I ever read.
 I don't remember what it was about, but I do remember reading it.
 Wisconsin.
 Northern Woodlands.
 Nothing to fucking do there.
 Boring, gotta do something.
 The Donald Duck comic books suck (there's piles of them, up there) and
 so I pick up an issue of Science Fiction and Fantasy Magazine.
 And I pick the absolute shortest thing that I can find that isn't letters
 to the editor.
 And its kind of disappointing, because its long.
 Like, over twenty pages.
 Oi vey.
 Long slog ahead.
 But whatever.
 I'm not gonna read another comic book, so dammit, if this is it, this is
 it.
 Its still early in the day, and its not like I have something better to
 do.
 So I read the short story.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And its not bad.
 And, you know, I could read more.
 (I think this is the next day.) and I think there is one more short story.
 But then there is this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

novella
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 And it is fucking seventy pages long.
 And I'm not going to read that, because it is just wayyyy too fucking long.
 And that sucks, and surely they could have put some short stories in there
 instead, instead of this fucking long novella.
 But, you know, out of desperation, I read it.
 It was not even science fiction, adding insult to injury.
 Thinking back, I think it was Stephen King.
 Something about a man and a high tower and a dusty bottle of whiskey.
 Stephen King has something with those elements.
 I even think they made it into a TV novella or something.

Anyway, I'm raised on sci-fi.
 Of course, the Asimov robot stories.

But I also spend a large chunk of my childhood reading electronics manuals.
 Why? I don't know.
 There were some at the library, and it's what I picked, and I could not
 tell you why I picked those instead of something else.
 So that's curious: I can tell you minute details about learning to read,
 but nothing at all about why I chose electronics later in life.
 So I get to the school career counseling session, and you are supposed
 to pick out three different career tracks: these are printed 8.5x11 cards,
 and they each describe a possible career, and you are supposed to pick
 out three of them, something you might want to do with your life, and discuss
 them with the career counselor at the front of the room.
 So I pick three: electronics design, and radio repair, and some distant
 third, like maybe running a TV station, something I did not want to do,
 but you have to pick three, so whatever.
 And the counselor gets mad: you were supposed to pick three *different*
 things, you moron, and you picked all three the same.
 So it is a very very short counseling session.
 He says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

So I get to college, and it is time to pick a major, and I pick physics.
 Why? I can tell you exactly why.
 A total and complete lack of imagination.
 Sure, history and art are options.
 I liked Lithuanian history, especially the knights: Karalius Mindaugas.
 And Algirdas and Kestutis.
 The union with the Poles, Liublino Unija, Jadwiga and all that, that kind
 of sucked.
 And I liked Art with a capital A.
 My uncle was a world-class fine artist, painting brilliant paintings.
 And its all lost.
 Well, not lost: those paintings are in my mom's house, and some are now
 in Kaunas, Ciurlionoio museum donation.
 And some canvases in Chicago, the watch-a-ma-call-it Lithuanian museum
 in, wherever that is.
 I don't have much dealings there.
 His paintings sit, forgotten, in a dark basement.
 It sucks.
 And I don't know how to fix that.
 My uncle deserves wayyyyy more recognition than he's gotten.
 Alas.
 Someday, I'll get around to this.
 But I digress.
 Back to college.
 I mean, I'm like really good at art, and I took four fucking years of Art
 History in high school.
 I know this shit.
 But the college major is physics, because, well, because.
 I don't think I even consider anything else, outside of these three.
 All other academic fields of study are on the other side of my personal
 cosmological event horizon.
 Mathematics would have been a distant fourth place.
 Later on I learn how to make mean, snide remarks about PoliSci, but I never
 get a chance to actually say them out loud.
 So physics it is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first-year class is a wash-out class.
 Starts with 150 students in a large ampitheatre lecture hall in Ryerson.
 Its already 120 by two weeks in, noticeably thinning, and maybe 70 by the
 fifth week.
 Half wash out in five weeks.
 I'm guessing the quarter ends with about 60.
 Year (two more quarters) end with maybe 50, and sophomore year starts with
 45, and I think its mostly stable.
 Maybe down to 40 or so, I dunno.
 I'm smoking lots of pot, and partying cause that's what you do in college.
 Its either that, or studying in the library from noon to closing time at
 10 PM.
 Fourth floor was my favorite.
 The cool kids say the 3rd floor was the best.
 What do I know.
 I'd try the 3rd floor, time to time.
 I liked the 4th better.
 Front of building, by the window bays.

Junior year, I realize physics is boring.
 I'm desperate.
 I'm ready to slit my wrists.
 No I'm not: that's just hyperbole, a hyperbolic statement.
 It's just something you say, its not like I ever thought about wrists or
 bleeding or killing myself or anything even remotely related to anything
 at all like that.
 But its an excellent hyperbolic statement.
 I'm ready to slit my wrists, that's how boring physics is.
 So I want to change my major.
 To what? I see the counselor.
 Well, there's PERL.
 Join PERL, you can write your own major.
 Do anything you fucking want, a special advisor will oversee your studies.

 And I say, thank you but no thank you.
 I sign up for a course on anthropology.
 South Sea Islands, and Structuralism, and all that.
 Another on child development.
 Lots of Piaget.
 I sit in the math library, and study books on Turing machines and Church
 and Lambda calculus, my junior year.
 I'm drawn to it magnetically, its like the hippest, coolest and most awesome
 thing to be found in the library, and I fervently wish for a universe where
 I could be transported, to study those things full time.
 But I never get very far, very deep, because, you know regular homework
 is, like, due, and there's only so much time for fucking around, no matter
 how beguiling the promise of AI in Turing machines might be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And one of the junior-year classes is intro to quantum mechanics.
 And things get weird here.
 So, first of all, its totally impenetrable.
 Ugo Fano, he must be 70 by now, he's fucking old, and I'm like still a
 teenager, I think 19.
 Much much later I find out I'm the youngest kid in my class.
 At University of Chicago.
 So I guess that makes me smart.
 Anyway, Ugo Fano is old and the textbook is impenetrable.
 It is a hand-typed manuscript, with hand-drawings.
 Published by the University of Chicago Press.
 Much later, second or third quarter, one girl in the class (the only girl?
 I wish I could remember her name, but I can't.
 She was ranked #2 in the graduating class.
 I was ranked #3.
 Who was #1? Fuck if I know.
 #1 was some home-schooled kid, like fourteen, who was like, you know too
 fucking young to even attended the classes the rest of us did.
 See, I'm smart.
 Youngest kid in the college, who is actually attending classes.
 Ranked #3 of all graduating physics majors.
 Number fucking three.
 Everything in my life, I'm number three.
 It's quite humbling.
 Even a kind of a curse.
 I could have been just plain stupid.
 Or I could have been number one and shrugged it off.
 But no, I'm number three.
 And still shrugging it off.
 But I digress.) So she comes back from the stacks, and she's got a book
 that explains what quantum spin is, cause you know its a total fucking
 mystery, what the fuck is spin? And there's this glossy, hard-cover textbook,
 classic crisp high-kaolin-content glossy paper textbook pages, elegant
 typesetting, good layout.
 Like a super-mainstream college textbook, the very model of what a textboook
 should be.
 And it explains spin.
 And there a diagram, and equations, recognizable equations, that we understand
 and somehow shed insight and understanding.
 And we are both like, wtf, why can't we use this textbook for class? This
 textbook is clear.
 And who wrote it? Ugo Fano.
 Yes.
 The same guy who is teaching us now.
 He wrote it 20 or 30 years earlier, published in the 1950's.
 A mainstream college physics quantum mechanics textbook.
 And not the only one.
 I think he wrote another, too.
 And instead of that, we are studying from this type-written, hand-drawn
 manuscript printed on plain white paper.
 This impenetrable morass of meandering re-analysis of the most fundamental
 and the most basic experiments from the dawn of the atomic age, trying
 to articulate quantum phenomena in a semi-classical language appropriate
 for 1910 or 1920.
 Thinking the way people were thinking in 1910 or 1920, before they had
 figured it out.
 Fano didn't say so, and we didn't know so, but in retrospect, that is what
 it was.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what was that? I think, when he got old, he realized that he did not
 understand quantum either, and had no clue what spin was.
 Here, the man who helped found quantum chemistry, and MO-LCAO (Molecular
 Orbital=Linear Combination of Atomic Orbiitals), a man who was actually
 famous for his contributions ot quantum mechanics.
 He didn't understand it.
 And so this typewritten manuscript was his last, best attempt to go back
 to the basics, and see if we missed something.
 Maybe there was a needle in the haystack.
 Something we missed, something important.
 If we only go back, and look at the evidence again.
 And that is what he was teaching.
 The raw evidence.
 The experiments.
 The minimalist, confusing semi-classical explanations of the experimental
 results.
 Confusing as shit for use youngsters.
 There is a reason that mainstream college textbooks win out.
 Even stupid kids can read mainstream college textbooks, and say

 This dooms the unclear text.
 Stupid people consign confusing things to the dustbin of history.
 The University of Chicago did not publish Ugo Fano's last and greatest
 attempt at explaining quantum mechanics on glossy paper with proper fonts.
 They did the minimal, honorable thing to do: they at least used acid-free
 paper.
 It hasn't yellowed.
 I still have it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, yeah, quantum is weird.
 My senior year, I take the first-year grad-school course in quantum mechanics.
 Love it.
 It's great.
 Quantum is fugnuts weird.
 I think I wrote about the prof in this diary before: he's the one who pulls
 me into his office, shuts the door, and makes me swear an oath to never-ever
 talk about quantum with ordinary laymen, people who do not have a formal
 education in physics.
 Like you know, he was swearing me into the Manhattan Project, or something.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So AI, and those classes on anthropology, and child development psychology,
 Piaget, that all pales and wastes away in the potent LSD of quantum mechanics.
 We're not talking Disney Magic, here.
 This is the real thing.
 Not fake Paris in DisneyWorld, but the real Paris.
 And Paris on LSD and shrooms.
 That's what quantum was.
 Except weirder.
 Like my prof pointed out, it's stranger than any Hollywood script (I nod),
 it's beyond the imagination of any script-writer (I nod).
 Beyond the ken of any sci fi writer.

 And you have to swear an oath.

\begin_layout Standard
So yes, my studies and pursuits of AI now take a back seat to physics.
 The same utter and complete lack of imagination on my part that lead me
 to select physics as a college major now cause me to get a PhD in physics.
 p.s.
 Did I mention I finished college in less than four years? Youngest kid,
 and I did it in three years and two quarters.
 Youngest kid except for that home-schooled boy.
 I took the last quarter to work at LASR more-or-less full time, writing
 FORTRAN to analyze Pioneer-10/11 spacecraft data.
 For John A.
 Simpson.
 I was fucking twenty.
 Just turned twenty.
 I was also fucking.
 Lost my virginity a few years earlier, and well, more or less lived with
 my girl.
 Fucking all the time.
 Margert Edsall.
 My understanding is she's Dean of Students at Columbia in New York City.
 So, not just any school, but like Ivy League.
 She married her housemate Mike Parides.
 Who lived in the room next door, while we fucked.
 He would fall asleep with the TV on.
 Poor guy.
 He's an MD.
 Margarets's dad was an MD.
 A world-class heart and pulmonary MD.
 Some Arab hired him once.
 Guys in dark suits, black mustaches and mirror shades whisked him off to
 a limo one night.
 I was there.
 They looked at me, and decided I was not a threat to Arabs.
 I assume Margaret married Mike because, well, Mike could get a job in New
 York, and I, well, I couldn't.
 I'd be an academic loser, tossing and turning and unable to find my place
 in life.
 Margaret was on a track.
 She knew where she was going.
 She also had some talents for manipulation.
 She wasn't mean or bad, or even controlling.
 But she got what she wanted.
 She knew how to get what she wanted.
 I didn't.
 I was lost and dazed and confused.

 Couldn't get much worse.
 Got a job at IBM eventually.
 So, actually, yeah, it could get worse.
 I spent what, two decades fucking dazed and confused at IBM? I learned

There's more to this story.
 I sank even lower.
 I'm recovering now, but its a bit late in life for that.
 I'm sixty-five, not twenty.
 I'm still smart.
 I've been doing AGI for 15-plus years now.
 Leveraging both physics and computer engineering, and of course, math,
 to do it.
 And all this time, the 15+ years I've been working on AGI, I never actually
 stopped and asked 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what is AGI?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Because it seems to be a self-evident question.
 But I want to ask that question in all seriousness now.
 To really explore it.
 What is AGI?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So here's the catch.
 It's 4PM.
 It is sunny outside, and I need some exercise.
 I am exhausted by the time/effort to write the above, I need to take a

 This is the same reason I'm not a bitcoin billionaire: it was sunny and
 warm outside, I needed to take a break.
 Installing that bitcoin miner would have been a cool thing to do, but I
 needed a break.
 So I'm going to do this to AGI, too.
 I told myself I'd get back to bitcoin mining, but I never did.
 I do plan to get back to AGI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's the deal.
 Talking and thinking about AGI won't be just a few pages or a few hours.
 As I told my son this morning: physics traps us in the prison of the here
 and now, the present.
 It gives us things like love, which I've known intimately, and things like
 evil, which I do not.
 Suffice it to say that some people really do seem to be evil (and not just
 stupid), and to be evil from a young age.
 Or something.
 This requires some intellectual effort.
 And now, with AGI, we (I? no, we.) We talk of building an artificial silicon
 intelligence that will occupy the same prison of here and now, and it is
 to be generally intelligent, which means, to me, to know love and evil.
 So the AGI topic will have to encompass that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And, of course, I will also ramble on about state vectors and high dimensions,
 and parallel Baysian priors (ahem, integrals) (Oh, I gotta copy those essays
 from the opencog wiki to here.) and I will talk about neural nets and LLMs.
 And of course high-dimensional vectors of jigsaws: sheafs, that is.
 Sheafs of networks.
 Sheaf-theoretic sheafs, and for what? The reason I have to step back and
 ask 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

what is AGI?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is because I'm getting lost in these details.
 Yes, blah blah agentic.
 Blah-blah sensori-motor.
 Blah blah world-model.
 Self and not self.
 And fucking free fucking will.
 This diary has already witnessed my flailing about with free will, and
 more than once.
 And so this is the question, the narrative: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What is AGI?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and if the answer doesn't give proper justice and dues to love and evil,
 if it doesn't give proper justice to free will and the prison of now, and
 if it doesn't give justice to everything we know about computer science
 and engineering and physics and math, and if that answer fails to incorporate
 the reality of Wetern Civilization and Political Economy (and captialist
 economy) and the affordances for humans to manipulated the world in which
 they live, affordances in the sense of handles on coffee cups taht allow
 me to pick up coffee cups easily without burning my hands, if the answer
 to the question of AGI does not somehow encompass fucking everything, then
 it is a failure.
 So that's the ground rules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh and one more rule, perhaps the most important of all: now what? What
 is there to be done, next? I mean, in the practical, immediate, consequential

 We've started the first O 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 which is not so much about what AGI is, because we answered that already:
 its everything.
 So,

Decide

 Now what, What do we do next? The Act part is easy: its a long slide downhill
 again.
 One foot in front of the other.
 But the Orient-Decide phase: this is the trap a trap like a fly on fly-paper.
 I have to be able to grasp AGI, which is, well, everything, and wrestle
 it into a position where I can decide to act, and to do so, unlike that
 unfortunate fly, of getting my belly stuck to the fly-paper.
 This is going to be a challenge.

Oh, I am going to eat an apple first.

\begin_layout Standard
First, lets get out of the way some basics: an AI has to be agentic.
 But a cruise missile is agentic, too.
 So this is where free will gets tangled in.
 I'm not sure I want to do that tangle, but it might be unavoidable.
 Classic AI is focused on rational inference, deduction.
 And I guess this is OK.
 When I learned to read Dr.
 Seuss, I was creating rational, inferential hypothesis about how my local
 sensory environment worked.
 And I was conscious of making those hypothesis.
 I recorded them in memory as my main intellectual activity.
 The actual 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

learning to read
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was a side-show, a pleasant distraction.
 The intellectual heavy-lifting was the decision to look for correlations
 between sight and sound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so we can weave this together to form the first lesson of AGI.
 We can create a system capable of reasoning and deduction, in the very
 classical AI sense, but the result might just be a cruise missile.
 Feeling-less, emotionless, formal deduction towards an end and then boom.
 We can build these kinds of formal reasoning systems, but this is not quite
 exactly what we want to identify with as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

being alive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Cruise missiles don't fall in love, nor would formal reasoning systems.
 Now, I employed a formal reasoning system, when I learned how to read.
 But I would like to say I am not a cruise-missile.
 Now, nature gave me a brain that allowed me to perform the activities of
 analyzing my environment, and thereby getting drawn into the activity of
 learning to read.
 But there was more: I was bored.
 I had nothing better to do.
 Well, maybe I did.
 Maybe I could have crawled around under the dining room table, which is
 a pretty marvelous architectural space, with all those columns of chair
 legs and table legs all about, a large open central atrium at the center
 of the table.
 A table cloth forming a curtain along the edges.
 Humans like to wander around in Medieval Catholic Cathedrals.
 They like to shop at malls with atriums.
 Even hotels are built like that.
 So crawling under the living room dining table is a thing, a real thing,
 and a valid pursuit as an alternative to deploying my intellectual abilities
 to discern sight and sound, to correlate the printed and spoken word in

 Suess book.
 And cruise missiles don't get bored, and cruise missiles don't crawl under

 inference and correlation engines to learn to read.
 Because, I guess, cruise missiles don't get bored.

\begin_layout Standard
So, yes, the classic AI concept of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

logical reasoning
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is important.
 But its not everything.
 And being an agent in the world is important, but its not everything.
 Having a world model is important, but not everything.
 The fucking thermostat has a one-bit model of the world: on or off, and
 it has the agential motor control of a header, coupled to a thermometric
 sensor.
 Does a thermostat have free will? The conventional, mainstream answer would
 be no.
 Does a thermostat get bored? I think not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So where does free will and boredom come from? I don't know.
 But one more aside first.
 Liebniz had the idea of monads, in pursuing the question of intelligence:
 splitting up intelligence into smaller and smaller pieces, and so we get
 panpsychism.
 The thing is, Liebniz did not know about phase transitions.
 I've already talked about percolation in this diary.
 Less than a certain fracture, oil does not flow.
 More than that, it does.
 And so with intelligence.
 There is a phase transition, below which there is no intelligence, and
 above which there is.
 We do not know where that phase transition is.
 And so perhaps that is one of the central questions of AGI: where is that
 phase transition? And where are cruise missiles located with respect to
 that transition? Or, fuck all, ants.
 Or amoeba.
 Yikes!

\begin_layout Standard
Later in the day.
 Post shower.
 What am I doing here? Writing a diary, obviously.
 Not science.
 Nothing I write here conforms to any conventional standards of science.
 Nothing would pass peer review.
 Amateur philosophy? See, the problem is most famous philosophers were crackpots.
 Smart, brilliant, even, but making inferences far beyond the ken of science.
 Give them some credit I guess, for venturing into the unknown.
 Subtract points for making assured claims with nothing but hand-waving
 for support.
 So I don't want to do that.
 Feynmann might advise 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shut up and calculate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but I already calculate a lot, so coming up for air, and asking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

why calculate this and not that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 seems like a legit thing to do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem with saying 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

intelligence appears on one side of a phase transition
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is that we don't have a coherent definition of intelligence.
 Clearly animals have it.
 Is it limited to neural nets? One can make coherent arguments that it is
 not.
 But is the behavior of slime molds 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

intelligent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? One slides down a panpsychic slide, attributing intelligence, or fractions
 thereof, to simpler and simpler systems.
 There's no obvious phase transition in there, somewhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What about free will? A few weeks earlier, in this diary, I came to conclusion,
 arguably total nonsense and hallucination, that free will arises at a Cauchy
 horizon.
 Now this is meant to be taken not literally, but metaphorically, but also
 meta-literally, in that there might be differentiable, causal structures
 appearing in our brains that have singularaties, singular solutions.
 So, first lets regurgitate the conventional reasons why my idea here is
 fundamentally bad.
 First, one hand-waves, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quantum gravity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, implying that if we had a theory of quantum gravity, then the singularities
 (in black holes) go away, and everything is hunky-dory, and no more Cauchy
 horizon, tah-dah.
 But that's physics.
 In math, we still have the issue that we can write down systems of equations,
 that happen to have applicability to physics, but those systems of equations
 admit solutions that are wonky.
 Quantum gravity does not alter the math one whit.
 The formal mathematical phenomena remains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What makes the Cauchy horizon interesting is that its not a set of measure
 zero.
 We've got a gazillion examples of singularities on the complex plane, but
 any geodesic-like curve one could draw, well most of them would have to
 bump into a set of measure zero.
 Now, there's some fascinating descent into the theory of the sizes of things,
 which promptly leads to the Axiom of Choice, and to Borel Hierarchies,
 and Cohen's forcing and all that.
 Wikedly interesting stuff.
 But the Cauchy horizon is not like that: living between the cracks.
 The Cauchy horizon is big and bold and measure-theoretically large.
 There's no Alexander's horns here, No knots sitting the three-spaces that
 bound 4-spheres.
 The horizon is big and bold and in your face.
 Its not going away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So my question is: are there any dynamical systems, aside from gravity,
 that exhibit Cauchy horizons, and might any of those dynamical systems
 appear in settings where intelligence arises? Can I build some mechanical
 or fluid-dynamic system, some analog, in which there is a Cauchy horizon?
 I'm thinking yes, I can.
 Well, maybe not me, but in principle, and maybe it is doable, and maybe
 someone has done it.
 Gonna search-engine that later.
 Say its doable, then are there any biological systems that would have that?
 We could go all reductionist here, but that's absurd because it would imply
 that we'd need quantum gravity to explain biology, and that is a non-starter.
 But still, are there any systems in nature, outside of the setting of gravitati
on, that exhibit a Cauchy horizon? If so, then can I ascribe this some property
 of free will? Anyone who reads this and is smart enough to understand what
 I'm saying will say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fuck no, Linas, that's crazy, that's wrong.
 You're nuts.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 So whatever.
 fuck you, too.
 See, I'm looking for free will, because if I can find that, it provides
 a workable definition of intelligence: things that have free will are intellige
nt, no matter how small and simple they are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, so here I anticipate another obvious objection.
 I can hear it now: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Linas you are talking about a random number generator, and mechanical systems
 hooked up to random number generators are not intelligent.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 And this is true.
 But the Cauchy horizon is not a random number generator.
 I want to argue more: it is an all-possibilities generator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So here.
 Conventionally, all-possibilities appear in the partition function:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z=\int\left[d\phi\right]\exp i\mbox{Action}
\]

\end_inset

Since the action contains derivatives, the discontinuous possibilities get
 a weighting of zero and don't contribute.
 Now, there are severe measure-theoretic difficulties plaguing the partition
 function, but that never stopped the physics community.
 Some what I'm now saying is, what if the action doesn't suppress a sizable
 number of non-differentiable field configurations 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

? Yes, of course, I'm piling on a mathematically ill-defined idea on top
 of something that is already ill-defined when its behaving nicely.
 What if free will and choice are those things that glue together the disparate
 universes?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To be clear on terminology: a single choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

universe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; universes and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 are in one-to-one correspondence, and the integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\left[d\phi\right]$
\end_inset

 is an integral over all universes.
 The exp i Action just gives the weighting or likelihood of that universe
 contributing to the partition function.
 FWIW, Bayesian priors work exactly like this.
 Now, by convention, one is to imagine that all of these distinct 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 are entirely independent of one-another.
 Nothing one can do in one can influence another.
 Perhaps oe imagines the 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 as sheets of paper, stacked.
 Close, but nothing written on one page bleeds to another.
 That's the conventional view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now what if, instead, the Cauchy horizon (or it's metaphorical replacement)
 is where all these sheets come together? The hand-waving argument would
 be that its like a singularity, say, the location 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

 in the complex plane for 
\begin_inset Formula $\log z$
\end_inset

.
 If you sit on a curve and fly into 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0,$
\end_inset

 you don't die, you just come out on every or any other sheet.
 If there's going to be a conservation of curves, then you're allowed to
 come out on any sheet of your choosing, but only one.
 What is that? A random–number choice? A flip-coin choice? Some axiom-of-choice
 thing? I don't know.
 I don't think its a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

random number
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and I don't know what it means 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

to choose
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in this situation.
 But this is an example of where a singular point glues together many sheets.
 But, you say, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

those sheeets were never independent universes.
 You could always get from one to the other by circling around the pole,
 gaining a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi i$
\end_inset

 each time around
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 And, yeah, well covering spaces tend to be simply connected.
 Or perhaps that's the definition of a covering space: its that simply-connected
 thing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I dunno.
 Perhaps I've gone off the deep end.
 But it seems like free will needs this kind of lugubrious theorizing, because
 otherwise, we are trapped with the nitwits who insist we don't have free
 will and its all just random numbers, but those people are nitwits.
 And they say, never argue with a fool, because the onlookers won't be able
 to tell the difference.
 So I'm not gonna argue with those fools.
 Instead I'll do some vague mathematical fantasizing.
 But really.
 I think part of what I sketch above has legs.
 I think something can be made of it.
 Tightened up, made concrete.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But this puts us in a chicken-and-egg scenario.
 If intelligent systems are exactly those that have free will, and I cannot
 give a workable definition of free will, then I'm hosed again.
 There are others, who are not nitwits, who think panpsychism is the answer.
 And anyway, its not like the panpsychists can offer up any kind of theoretical
 mechanics that allows a workable definition of intelligence to be coded
 up in software.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I seem to hit a dead end here.
 One that I've hit before.
 Although this time, I think I made a tiny amount of progress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Are there other ways of thinking about AGI? Well, I suppose I could take
 a more mundane and pedestrian view.
 Lets take a moment to walk through those.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So one is the agentic system.
 A system that has a model of the world, a distinct inside and outside,
 a sensori-motor system.
 But we've already noted that thermostats and cruise missiles have this,
 and I don't want to give those any ascriptions of being alive or intelligent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then there's explosive replicators.
 DNA embodied in bacteria, etc.
 explosively replicate as long as there's food.
 And conventionally, we say bacteria are alive.
 So I'm OK with saying explosive replicators are alive.
 But that's also not AGI.
 I can't build a computer model of a bacterium and pass it off as AGI, because...
 because why? Because it cannot be hooked up to google and work as an oracle
 for answering questions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So is an oracle for answering questions, is that AGI? Well clearly, good
 AGI would be an oracle (well, oracle-like in the informal sense, not the
 computer-science sense).
 But the converse ain't true.
 Oracles aren't AGI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I felt I was onto something, when I started talking about boredom, and love,
 and evil.
 Love is ...
 well, love can be explained away as some limbic, somatic, reptilian-brain
 response for procreation, but anyone who has been in love knows that this
 is an inadequate, mechanistic explanation offered up by nitwits who like
 to pretend that they're know-it-alls.
 I can't speak for the poets, but the movie 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The Fifth Element
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich does get the general nature of the
 thing correct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dafuq.
 I used the word lugubrious.
 I can use it again.
 Wander down the hallways of love, boredom and evil and kind of not get
 any closer to a workable definition of AGI than I didn't have before.
 Is it like Art? 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can't define it, but I know it when I see it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 But I'm not trying to reduce Art to an algorithm.
 I am trying to reduce AGI to an algorithm but it seems right up there with
 trying to reduce love, boredom and evil to an algorithm.
 I mean, if you can't define it, you can't create software that works at
 that level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the risks are equally obvious: like creating that 18th century robotic
 schoolboy, sitting at his desk writing schoolwork: a simulacrum can be
 created, but that's not the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real thing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The Polish sci-fi writer, Stanislaw Lem, has some story where reality is
 shown to be some LP recording, the mechanism of which is dicey and jamming.
 I can build a simulacrum of love, but that's not love.
 Again, we slip into philosophy.
 I had a book, while still a teen, Daniel Dennet.
 It was OK.
 It did not light my fire.
 But it did illustrate one story with a cute robotic mouse with winking
 glowing LED eyes, and cooing sounds, and the protagonist is asked to smash
 it with a hammer.
 Its just a freakin robot, but we have this mammalian gut reaction to little
 furballs.
 There's even a TV commercial, from Ikea, that features an old sad desk
 lamp abandoned in the rain by the garbage.
 And a full length feature film, Brave Little Toaster, the ending of which
 is heart-rending.
 So these are the mammalian, limbic, somatic shadows of existence that we
 are immersed in.
 And my definition of AGI says that it too must partake of this world.
 And of course, I can create some software that claims that it does, but
 this is like that Star Trek episode where Data is placed on trial, accused
 of not being an actual being, of being a machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where's the phase transition to being-ness? Are you getting bored by this?
 Because I am.
 Clearly mammals are beings, and we do down that path and end up at panpsychism
 again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You want to know how crazy I am? I'll tell you how crazy I am.
 If the universe doesn't stop me, first.
 Every time I'm about to do something stupid, the dog barks, and I say to
 myself, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

this is the universe reminding me to stop doing this stupid thing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 And I'm typing this on a laptop with a shitty keyboard and a shitty touch-pad,
 and I'm making vast amounts of typos due to the mechanical misbehavior
 of this system vs.
 my hands.
 and every time I'm about to type something really exceptionally good, it
 gets tangled up, and again I think: this is the universe trying to stop
 me from spilling it's secrets.
 That's how crazy I am.
 I get those micro-thoughts, and I give them credence and credibility just
 long enough to wonder if its true.
 Because you know it could be.
 Who the fuck knows.
 The universe really could be fucking with me like that, because who is
 to say it isn't.
 We already have the Mandela effect.
 I didn't invent it, but I do suffer from it.
 I remember Nelson Mandela dying in a South African prison back in the 1980s
 so what the fuck is all this about him still being alive and all that?
 WTF Really? Maybe universes do cross over, or maybe the combination of
 statistics, news reporting and neuroscience just makes me victim to a mass
 delusion.
 Who is to say?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, and then there's math.
 I might have touched on this a bit in this diary, but really I could do
 more.
 Math is a potent hallucinogen.
 I don't feel like explaining this right now, but for a quick tour, look
 at what people said about the Cantor set, and what he did.
 It's crazy-hallucinatory.
 Obviously.
 Then there's the various paradoxes of measurability.
 Say the Banach-Tarski paradox.
 Crazy shit.
 There's lots more.
 Anything to with infinity.
 I think I've mentioned before the insanity of weak convergence in Hilbert
 spaces.
 QM is insane mostly because of this one thing, but that means that the
 problem lies not with QM, but with weak convergence in Hilbert spaces,
 which is the root cause of quantum weirdness.
 So its not the physics that's insane, its the math.
 And so if math, the most staid, assured, unassailable, confident rock-hard
 foundation-stone of all things knowable: I mean really, who is going to
 argue that 2+2 isn't 4? This is a fact 2+2=4 and nothing you can do can
 change that.
 Its the rock-hard foundation.
 And that foundation includes fucking goddamned fucking prime numbers.
 And Banach-Tarski.
 And weak convergence in Hilbert spaces.
 And axioms of large cardinals.
 And Borel hierarchies.
 So fuck me, fuck that, math is fucking insane.
 Our foundation-stone of reality, 2+2=4, is simply the logo stamped on a
 universe-sized tablet of LSD.
 And fuck me, what, you want me to algorithmicize this, and build you an
 AGI? I homunculus based on the the mystical elements of the Kaballah? Really?
 You don't need to get mystical.
 The mystical is already here, right now.
 Pervasive and permeating pan-mysticism.
 Sheesh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I must bring tonight's OODA loop of exploring AGI to an end.
 The observe and orient stuff ended with disorientation, and identified
 the proximal cause of that disorientation.
 Its built into the fucking math.
 So, deeper than being built into the fucking universe, its built into the
 fucking math.
 Excuse the swear words, but I know obscenity when I see it, and math is
 obscene.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Decide and Act.
 Well, the mundane decision is to tough it out.
 Put on that heavy back-pack, tie your boots and go out into that storm.
 Hump it over the mountain.
 Metaphorically, this means go out and read more academic journal articles,
 and participate in the day-today quotidian intellectual activities of the
 social world around me.
 This is, I guess, an admission of defeat.
 Not that I was ever expecting to win.
 But laser-like focus on a narrow topic is an excellent way of making dramatic
 progress, and I am anything but laser-like here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another analogy.
 I could moan about number theory here, instead of AGI.
 Or I could just go out and do it.
 I think I did pretty well with the beta transform: hundreds of pages of
 laser-like, focused, insightful results.
 And no one cares because who the fuck cares about iterating 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta x\mod1$
\end_inset

? Almost no one.
 Maybe more than the number of people who care about this diary.
 Because the beta transform, the iterated 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta x\mod1$
\end_inset

 is considered to be unimportant.
 And see, that is my dilemma.
 I could spend the waning years of my life making sharp, insightful progress
 on narrow topics that are not important.
 Or I could moan about the inaccessibility and ineffability of AGI.
 Or I could just fucking give up, and just do something that would bring
 me closer to nvidia gpus and weights and shut up and calculate, as Feynmann
 would say.
 Or I could cast about.
 Because, see, all these other things are boring.
 I don't quite really want to do them, because they're not ...
 they're not worthy of my time.
 They're not a valid activity to while away the years.
 By contrast, moaning about the ineffability of AGI into this diary does
 seem like something worthwhile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let me be more direct.
 I think there's something here, and I think I could even make a bit of
 progress, if I could get my hands on it.
 But like the four-year-old stacking blocks, the blocks keep fumbling out
 of my hands.
 Something, something.
 Agential sensori-motor.
 Something something category theoretic.
 These blocks.
 I can almost assemble them.
 And then the self doubts: I assembled some blocks.
 Is that a house that can be lived in? Is it a Roman coliseum? No.
 Is it AGI? err.
 Fuck.
 The blocks keep slipping away.
 But I think I've almost got my hands in it.
 If I just try a bit more.
 Something something Basal cognition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, reading more is really not a bad idea.
 It takes me back into the first O of OODA: more observation.
 Its a deferral of decide and act.
 Its more orientation.
 How much longer to decide and act? What's there to decide, if I can't figure
 out what the fucking problem is? I'll sleep on it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I finished Tong's Lecture 2 on cosmology Lecture 3 awaits.

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, footnote.
 I'm loosely spell checking above, and Chinese Room pops into my mind.
 I always hated the Chinese room argument, I thought it was dumb.
 I see why some people feel like its worthwhile.
 But those people are just dumb.
 The Chinese room is like asking the sand grains in a sand-pile about how
 they know when to avalanche.
 You can look at any given grain of sand all you want, microscopic examination,
 and it won't get you to an adequate understanding of avalanches.
 So the same with the Chinese Room.
 Yes, you've got all these guys running around programmatically stacking
 algorithmic inferences and deductions, using the finest in proof theory
 and lambda calculus to do it, and then it all avalanches, and no one saw
 it coming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so maybe that's my definition of AGI.
 Its a proof-theoertic stack of inferences, so tall and so carefully balanced,
 hinged on countless delicate assumptions, that nudge some tiny little Bayesian
 prior, and half the stack comes sliding down in an avalanche.
 That avalanche is no longer algorithmic certainty, proof-theoretic provability
 carried out by minions in the Chinese room.
 One of the shmucks spilled a bottle of ink on the instructions, faked it
 and it all comes sliding down.
 This is what's wrong with the Chinese Room.
 The philosophers were so busy studying philosophy, that they didn't learn
 any physics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, my two-paragraph rebuttal of the Chinese Room is literary and
 allusory.
 What, exactly, in a stack of crisp proof deductions, comes tumbling down?
 Nervous breakdowns are breakdowns.
 Electrical dielectric failures are breakdowns.
 Tears, cracks, shattering.
 What, exactly, is supposed to be the analog of dielectric failure in symbolic
 reasoning? What's avalanching? Well, I earlier stated that 2+2=4 is rock
 solid, incontrovertible, unchallgengable, unalterable.
 I skipped mentioning 2+2 mod 3=1 In this tower of deduction, was there
 some quotienting there, where no one was paying attention? Something in
 a sigma-pi hierarchy modulo some for-all, there exists, that has some alternati
ve interpretation, alternative valuation, different outr model than the
 intended model? That would avalanche.
 If something has multiple models, then what is true in one model might
 not be true in another.
 If the Chinese Room guys were working in one model, but really there was
 some other semantic interpretation, they were deriving things that were
 falsehoods when applied to the inner model.
 Some downward Skolem-Lowenstein lemma type thing.
 That would be the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

avalanche
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: you thought we were working 
\begin_inset Formula $\aleph_{0}$
\end_inset

 but I thought we were working with 
\begin_inset Formula $\aleph_{1}$
\end_inset

 and so you're getting not just contradictions, but avalanches of incompatible
 inferences.
 That's the avalanche.
 That's how the Chinese room fails.

Modulo is weird.

 The place where

 And this is merely the first level of the sigma–pi hierarchy.
 There is an entire tower there, ready to fuck you and Banach–Tarski.
 Pleasantly fuck.
 While you're tripping on LSD.
 But fuck in surprising ways.

\begin_layout Standard
After yesterdays histrionics, lets see if we can do better today.
 We can take the pragmatic definition of AGI: it is that economically viable
 thinking machine that can replace high-priced engineers (and other high-priced
 humans) in the delivery of economically viable services.
 I've been talking to one fellow who wants to digest electronics diagrams
 and the surrounding English–language documentation to automate a repetitive
 process that engineers currently perform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is an eminently practical desire, the kind of which has been driving
 economics since about forever.
 It is also a task on the forefront of what is barely possible and achievable
 with current technology.
 Insofar as I personally want to toil away on the creation of AGI, this
 is perhaps a task in which I should invest significant intellectual effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets for a moment imagine what this might be.
 Or not.
 Technology is in rapid flux, tools, features and functions are rapidly
 changing.
 What is commercially available right now can be adapted in this and such
 a way to the task.
 The tech stack selection I might make for a customer might be different
 from the tech stack I might wish to make for myself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets do some forecasting and prognostication.
 I have to be careful here.
 First and foremost, we have the sci-fi writers, who are quite good at looking
 at some present-day situation and extrapolating it to the future.
 We've got the TV show Black Mirror, which makes dark prognostications.
 Any number of youtube scifi shorts going in any number of directions.
 Amateur gatherings, like Less Wrong, exploring, like ants working a food
 source, exploring the implications of this or that.
 Some are vastly smarter than others; Scott Alexander with Slate Star Codex
 rises far above.
 Some prognostications are economically valuable: Peter Zeihan seems to
 make a good living cooking up geopolitical ideas of all sorts.
 In short, there already is a rather extensive effort, work-front looking
 at present trends and extrapolating them into the future.
 It is hard to stay on top of it all.
 I've tried, and there are others who devote fulltime attention to this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why is it hard? For simple economic reasons: There are thousands, more,
 tens of thousands, and yet more, hundreds of thousands, if I count twitter
 posters, who are actively engaged in this.

There's a different kind of prognostication, of the form done by David Chapman
 on Meaningness.
 In a different way, by John Vervaeke in his lecture series on the Meaning
 Crisis.
 This (these) are again very modern developments.
 Yes, sure, the bourgeoisie of the 18th and 19th century could have nervous
 breakdowns because the meaning provided by society did not align with innate
 biological (somatic) drives.
 And then there are the Shakers, Quakers and any number of Protestant sects
 attempting to realign ways of existing with neurological drives, attempting
 to provide an all-encompassing answer, if not an eschatology.
 What's curious here is that the Quakers expose this as a modern-day example
 of the Meaning Crisis in an agrarian society.
 This is useful, because we don't have this for the Romans.
 Agrarian, politically very advanced, but the written record that the Romans
 left behind does not document psychological suffering.
 One does have to wonder why that is.
 Is it because the people who prepared Roman History for us, from Tacitus
 to modern times, have merely overlooked this? Is it because the society
 was too preoccupied with the act of living to get caught up in the doldrums
 of vague, unspecific dissatisfaction with life, building into an outright
 crisis? I don't know enough about Rome to say.
 Perhaps this is well-explored somewhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And this is another issue: everything is well-explored.
 Again, because of the economic richness of the current society has allowed
 vast numbers of intelligent, educated humans to explore all sorts of nooks

I'm slipping into another groove that I visit and wrestle with: the entropy
 landscape from chemistry, bacterial quorum sensing, slime-mold decision

, high speed neurotransmitter star-gate transport, and then up through neuroanat
omy to humans.
 And of course it does not stop there: it continues on up into the economic
 world.
 And it feeds back: the nicotine industry supplies brains very directly
 with a desirable neurotransmitter.
 Christmas toy baubles are a few steps removed from the direct hit of nicotine
 or heroin, but, in some ways, drive the same, or similar neuro-anatomical,
 neuro-biochemical circuits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I once read a SciAm article on the mechanism of nicotine addiction: it was
 a stack of 5 or six chemical and neurological feedback loops, working at
 different timescale, each one of them craving nicotine.
 One feedback loop involved reuptake channels in synapses.
 That functions on the one-minute timescale.
 Something else, I forget what, provided feedback at the 15-minute to half-hour
 timescale, and is responsible for chain-smoking.
 Other drives function at the week and multi-month timescales, making nicotine
 addiction hard to break: even if you shut down the hour-by-hour craving,
 there is still that circuit, lingering in the back of your head, that remembers
 how pleasurable smoking is, and reminds you, month after month, that, well,
 it ws pleasurable.
 That's all.
 Have one now and you could relive that pleasure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Huh.
 Relive that pleasure.
 This is the rewind button that the physics of here and now does not have.
 We cannot time-travel back in time to change things, but we can recreate

 And again and again, because those prior conditions were pleasurable.

 The algorithms, like Data in Star Trek, or the Chinese Room, or, for chris

 Literature, but there is no reason to believe that LLM's actually suffer
 from nicotine cravings.
 The biological mechanism cannot be traced.
 An LLM can tell me all it wants about craving cigarettes.
 It can tell me about how it remembers eating ice-cream in childhood.
 I know both are a lie.
 This is the point the Chinese-Room people were trying to make.
 And, at that level, they were perfectly correct.
 They were only wrong in elevating it up to some sacred philosophical principle.

Nicotine and heroin are good for this kind of analysis, because we understand

\begin_layout Standard
Nicotine and heroin are nice, because they also provide a scalpel with which
 to dissect Western Civ.
 The scalpel reveals that it is the drive to greater complexity that seems
 to matter.
 Heroin addiction is frowned upon because it is an economic and social waste.
 So, perhaps like leakage currents in an integrated circuit: it siphons
 off what is otherwise usable energy.
 The bio-feedback circuits build up to a stack of 4 or 6 cycles deep, and
 then no deeper.
 Maybe they layer on one or two more feedback loops: the economic industry
 that produces heroin.
 The feedback here is financial.
 But, in many ways, it is destructive: economically, it seems like a net-loss.

 makes the case that WWI was a socio-economic organization that was hostile
 to human life.
 It killed young men at an industrial scale, and continued to do so until
 it literally ran out of raw material.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So this allows us to compare nicotine, heroin and WWI.
 So, nicotine is a multi-billion-dollar economic organization, dating back
 to three or four centuries, supplying human brains with a desirable neurotransm
itter at an industrial scale.
 I already reviewed some of the nicotine addiction reinforcement cycles,
 working at the minute, hour, day and month timeframes.
 These feedback loops were biochemical at the lowest level, neurological
 at the middle level, neuro-anatomic at the high level (memories of pleasurable
 minutes spent smoking pass through hippocampus and amygdala: this is anatomy,
 sitting above the neuronal circuit level).
 Now we are ready to add one more feedback loop: cigarette advertising.
 This loop operates at the socio-economic level.
 Corporations buy billboard space, magazine pages and TV time from willing
 owners of TV stations, magazine and billboards, all to remind individuals
 how pleasurable smoking is.
 Thank goodness for ...
 well, that stuff in the 1970's that resulted in making cigarette advertising
 illegal.
 So it shut down another deleterious feedback cycle.
 This one operating at the super-human level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And that is how one reduces cultural drives to entropic forces.
 This is kind of the big-bang theory of economics.
 We take bacterial quorum sensing, which involves small polypeptide signaling
 molecules, of which nicotine is but one example, and ratchet this up through
 neurons, and then brains, and then society.
 From Atoms to Geopolitical forces, in one reductionist tour-de-force.
 Nicotine is nice, because it shows the clear path.
 Heroin is nice, because it shows the same path, but is far more obviously
 recognizable as deleterious.
 It shares much or most of the chemical, macro-molecular, neural and neuro-anato
mical systems with nicotine, but diverges at the social and political level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

.
 Someone had to grow cabbages in the field, to feed the soldiers, and someone
 had to run the factories that fixed nitrogen into explosive.
 This was an economic, industrial activity, and in this way resembles the
 economic and industrial activity of nicotine, substituting cabbage heads
 for tobacco leaves.
 The biochemical route is detached.
 The call to patriotism detaches somewhere at the socio-cultural layer,
 where upbringing and education are dominant forces, and perhaps at the
 genetic level, insofar as many individuals are predisposed to act in a
 certain way, in the same sense that certain dog breeds or horse breeds
 behave the way they behave.
 Patriotism is not a signaling molecule like nicotine.
 But it is a stable and solid-enough foundation on which to build the apparatus
 of WWI.
 Or, for that matter, the current russian war on Ukraine.
 And fuck all with the suicidal North Koreans.

 There's a symbolic layer hard at work, and symbology is pervasive.
 We have some tools for it: as mentioned, the lambda calc, the combinators,
 the category theory.
 The LLM's less so, they come in from the side, and need further theoretical
 analysis.
 But the name of the game is to boil down everything to structural analysis:
 from economics to genetics.
 Fringier is education, culture, advertising, propaganda, upbringing, political
 power.
 But these are just fringier.
 Softer than electrical circuits, because we are not used to drawing diagrams
 for these things.
 That's changing: we can now draw diagrams for the movement of populations
 across continents through the millennia.
 We can talk about how the populations carried both their genes and their
 language, and we can sketch circuit diagrams for this.
 Not very accurate ones: we need more archaeology, more genetics, more history
 to get more details, but the base connections are there.
 Some details might remain fuzzy forever.

\begin_layout Standard
And so that is the practical definition of AGI: the economically useful
 mechanical device that can be employed to understand electrical circuits,
 economic forces, and the biochemical process of aging and death.
 Represent all of this symbolically, and provide the tools to access and
 manipulate these representational structures using either language – text
 chat – or possibly GUI's with click-and-point.
 So, geographical maps, for example, if interested in geographical economic
 activity, history wars, or migration patterns of pre-historic humans.
 AGI is the common tool that can encapsulate and expose all of this.

 But we are getting there.
 You can train an NN on the Mandelbrot set, and it will draw a a good-enough
 approximation thereof.
 You can train an NN on a collection of propositions from first-order logic,
 and i will be able to generate the generative results: extracts from the
 language generated by the axioms and propositions f first order logic.
 And the ditto for second order: the relation between language and generation
 and axioms is well-understood by the proof-theorists and the model theorists.
 And someone out there is already aiming NN's at this material.
 SO we are getting there.

\begin_layout Standard
Alas, cracks and leakage currents remain.
 Culture Wars 2.0 have given us Trump supporters capsizing water-ski boats,

And where does this lead us? Well, again the examined and unexamined flows

 We are sufficiently removed from the Soviet system that it makes for a
 good model.
 Its more recent than WWI.
 It is less ambiguous that WWI; both sides of WWI didn't quite know what
 they were doing.
 The Soviets did.
 They figured out what they were doing, and then they honed it and developed
 it into a powerful totalizing system.
 Hitler started this, and he did understand the role of propaganda, but
 he shot his wad too soon.
 I can't make a cogent case that he should have paused after the Anschluss,
 this is for someone else to make.
 But the post-war Soviet Empire had the time and the space to refine and
 hone its methods.
 It could deport entire nations to Siberia, and do it effectively, without
 interference.
 The irony here is that even as the KGB reached new heights of sophistication
 and technique in the control of propaganda, brain-washing and political
 messaging, at the very same time, the nomenklatura became increasingly
 incompetent.
 They did not know how to promote capable people.
 In the end, we had Gorbachev, the most incompetent of the incompetent,
 governing an entire nation, and then the wheels came off.
 The only good news is that Trump appears to be more or less just as incompetent
 as Gorbachev.
 The wheels won't come off; the American machine is orders of magnitude
 stronger than the Soviet apparatus ever was.
 But we do have the socio-economic problem of placing incompetents in positions
 of great power.
 Not that the Democrats don't have their own issues on this front.

So that's the aside: in capitalism, we have hierarchical structures of executive

 From the middle to the upper ranks, up to the CEO, its much more of a political

 is going to have a hard time of it all, no matter how good they are at
 politics.
 Incompetent CEO's, and unlucky CEO's find themselves at the head of bankrupt
 companies, and, if the company is smaller, it is allowed to fail and dissolve.
 The bigger ones are too big to fail.
 Which is unappetizing,but no one has a better idea.
 At the national level, we have forces that elevate total nincompoops like

 How do I do this limited thing? First, there is a perceptual component:
 the file systems have to be perceived.
 What should be perceived? What matters, what doesn't? I've written a hand-craft

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 which itself is a non-trivial question.

 The way a gas occupies an empty box, so here, the goal is occupation of

 Not even mixing is really required.
 Survival, however, has no obvious simple-minded physics analogs, other
 than perhaps to indicate that the ecological niche can be both extremely

If I go backwards, and ask how I can hand-build a system capable of perceiving,

 I don't seem to have any generic tools or API's for any of this.
 There is no theory of generic perception that I'm aware of.
 There's no generic perceptual system API.
 Pixels and sound can be perceived, on a case-by-case basis, problem domain

Perhaps generic is a dream.
 Perhaps generic can never exist, and that a collection of special-purpose

 But then we are back to assembly: if I have a bunch of special-purpose
 tools, how do I adapt these to communicate to one another? I guess I need
 a giant portfolio of adapters.
 In this case, the industrial winner is the one who has the largest portfolio.
 But this then becomes ecological: here and there, there might be a very
 specialized tool, highly adapted for a given task.
 There might be some blunt and crude tool, fit for a broad range, but not
 honed.
 So I need an ecology of tools, and an ecology of adapters to connect them,
 to wire them.

I was going to write something about tools, but instead I've been reading

 So I have some questions.
 Lets assume a de Sitter universe.
 Lets say I have two masses, connected by a string.
 As the universe expands, I should see a tension on on that string, because
 each mass is being carried by the expanding spacetime: they would normally
 move apart, but for the string holding them together.
 What is the tension on that string? Numeric quantity? How bit is it, in,
 say, Newtons?

HOw about microscopically? Hubble expansion means that two ends of a DNA

 How about a hydrogen atom? It's being pulled apart, but the electrostatic

\begin_layout Standard
If the universe is expanding, perhaps I should think of the atoms as getting
 smaller.
 Everything is getting smaller: that's why there's red-shift: things were
 bigger, before.
 Is this style of thinking consistent with the conventional interpretation,
 that we stay the same size, but the universe gets bigger? I'm confused.
 How do we know how big something is, anyway? Is the universe expanding,
 or are my rulers shrinking? Have I been skimming the equations too casually?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm willing to accept that my time-like velocity (proper time) never changes.
 But if I measure time with rubidium atoms, or whatever, and Hubble expansion
 is pulling my clock apart, held together only by electrostatic i.e.
 mechanical i.e.
 electro-quantum-mechanical forces, then doesn't this expansion throw off
 my time measurement? The mechanical holding-together causes the two ends
 of the clock to be accelerating towards each other.
 How big is that acceleration? Does it throw off the time measurements?
 By how much?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, all these numbers will be stunningly tiny, since 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}=73$

 km/s/Mpc and

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}=2.4\times10^{-18}$
\end_inset

Hz.
 So if my meterstick is 1 meter long, after one second, the two ends tried
 to move 
\begin_inset Formula $2.4\times10^{-18}$
\end_inset

 meters apart, and would have needed a relative velocity of 
\begin_inset Formula $2.4\times10^{-18}$
\end_inset

 meters/second to maintain a constant distance.
 I'm totally confused.
 This is a velocity, not an acceleration.
 Oh, but of course: the two ends were instantaneously at rest, so during
 that second, they had to be accelerated to hit that velocity.
 So the ends are accelerating at 
\begin_inset Formula $2.4\times10^{-18}m/sec^{2}$
\end_inset

 and if I put a 1 kg weight at the end of a 1 m string, this will require

 Newtons tension on the string to maintain constant distance.

Huh.
 Peculiar velocity of milky way is 500 km/sec.

 I'm cross-eyed and delirious.
 Did I screw this up? Hubble takes a single galaxy and stretches it by a

 Why don't the textbooks on cosmology mention this? Maybe because I haven't

 This is above the speed of light.
 I expect the observable horizon to sit at the speed of light.
 I guess, I should have used radius, not diameter, but this still says the

 no sense.
 At least not in the Newtonian sense.
 Well, deSitter expands at

 Is the instrument insensitive to this, because the wavelength of the measuremen

 keeping the apparent distance constant?

Rather than flailing in private, I decided to flail in public.
 Here: https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/59208/measuring-hubble-expans
ion-in-the-lab and a cut-n-paste:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a high-school level physics question.
 The Hubble expansion is dramatic at the cosmological level, but absurdly
 tiny at the human scale.
 H0 is 73 km/s/Mpc and 1Mpc is 3×1019 km.
 Converting to a human scale, H0=2.4×10−18 Hertz.
 So, if I take two masses, in free-fall, originally at rest with respect
 to each other, starting out one meter apart, and I wait one second, then
 I should find that the distance between these two masses will have increased
 by 2.4×10−18 meters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose I take two free-falling mirrors, separate them by 5 kilometers,
 and then wait one second for the Hubble expansion to pull them apart.
 The distance between them would presumably change by 1.2×10−14 meters.
 Absurdly tiny, to be sure, but a distance that LIGO is sensitive to.
 So my question is, is this change actually measurable?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I can attempt to answer my own question.
 The answer would be "no", because Hubble expansion implies that the wavelength
 of the laser light heading down the tunnels is also lengthening, thus cancellin
g the effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Presumably, the laser light is also red-shifting, but this effect is ten
 orders of magnitude smaller then the frequency stability of those lasers.
 However, there are light-sources that are extremely stable: the optical
 lattice clocks, the best of which have one part in 1018 frequency stability.
 These are extremely dim, so unusable (I guess?) for measuring that 5km
 distance.
 However, the Hubble redshift for light at optical frequencies seems ..
 almost within reach.
 Blue light is 4×1014 Hz.
 Over the course of an hour, it should Hubble red-shift by 1 Hz.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A velocity-stabilized clock is needed to cancel out redshift from ordinary
 Minkowski relative motion.
 LIGO provides that amount of velocity-stability.
 It seems that the Hubble redshift would then be measurable, unless it is
 cancelled out e.g.
 because of the motion stabilization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A different variant of above: The Pound-Rebka experiment measured the redshift
 of falling photons.
 The precision was possible because of the rather weird Mossbauer effect.
 If that setup was changed to horizontal, and motion-stabilized a la LIGO,
 then, again, it seems that Hubble expansion would be lab-measurable.
 That is, unless I fundamentally mis-understand Hubble expansion and how
 it interacts with lab devices.
 Perhaps the motion stabilization precisely cancels out the Hubble expansion?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My question is a kind-of ball of confusion about distance and time dilation
 effects as experienced by Earth-bound lab instruments.
 Measuring distance is dicey, if the length of your ruler is changing.

 The above is an admission that I can't punch my way out of a wet GR paper
 bag.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, lets try, anyway.
 First, LIGO is sensitive in the 100-200 Hz range, and quite insensitive
 to slow drifts, which is what the Hubble expansion would be.
 If I recall correctly, its 5 orders of magnitude less sensitive at 1Hz,
 and that the proposal to get past this is the LISA space-based interferometer.
 I need to review that wiki page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, I'm tangled up between instrumental effects and relativistic physics
 effects.
 In LIGO, the distance between the mirrors is held fixed, interferometrically.
 That's all we've got; can't measure position w.r.t.
 the building, because the building is moving, the ground is moving from
 day/night heating/cooling cycles.
 Even deep underground, in a mine, there will be non-trivial low-frequency
 movements, far far greater amplitudes.
 I am wildly guessing that the ambient noise from geophysical motion is
 well in excess of a nanometer, even deep in some mine in Sardina, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

geophysically quietest place on Earth
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 according to Wikipedia and the Italian boosters.
 So, active noise suppression requires feedback loops, and the control signal
 is effectively interferometric, which is red-shifting, stretching right
 along with Hubble.
 The mirrors are held fixed w.r.t.
 that distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm doubly confused.
 The 1960 definition of the meter was defined as a count of a certain number
 of Krypton wavelengths.
 Due to Hubble expansion, that definition would cause the meter to get longer
 by one part in 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{18}$
\end_inset

 every second.
 Now, the length is defined as unit of time, times speed of light, which
 is definitionally a constant.
 Thus, if the meter were to dilate, it would be only because time varied.
 But proper time in empty space is, again definitionally constant, and the
 problem on Earth is obtaining isochronous surfaces, due to local gravitational
 wells.
 I wonder how much noise there is, in these isochronous surfaces.
 How far does an iso-chronous surface move, due to a passing automobile?
 How much does it move, due to geophysical movements? Heck, how about Moon-drive
n tidal effects? I guess Sun and Moon might be biggest contributors.
 OK.
 So, how big is that? What's the number?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wikipedia tells me the HeNe laser wavelength definition of the meter is
 good to 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times10^{-11}$
\end_inset

 and so we are off by seven orders of magnitude of suitability for wavelength
 measurements.
 Cesium fountains are good to 
\begin_inset Formula $5\times10^{-16}$
\end_inset

 while the optical lattices are 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-19}$
\end_inset

.
 So, Cesium fountains are not good enough, but the lattices are, just barely.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem is the length measurement itself.
 How? Perhaps it would be possible to modulate the laser(s) with a pseudo-random
 code, a la GPS P/N or Y codes.
 The modulation, say, phase modulation, could be mild enough to not increase
 overall phase noise (uhhh, really??) or otherwise adversely affect operation.
 Such modulation allows you to measure distances, by measuring round-trip
 times.
 But to what accuracy?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a 1 kilohertz modulating signal.
 Measuring the edge of the signal bit-flip might be done down to a microsecond?
 But this is still 300 meters, twenty orders of magnitude out of the ballpark.
 Modulating at the terahertz level is possible, I guess: just build a terahertz
 shift register with taps on it? So Terahertz is 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{12}$
\end_inset

 Hz.
 Times speed of light is 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times10^{-4}$
\end_inset

 meters.
 That's terrible.
 Am I missing something? Counting wavelengths works, apparently.
 Measuring distance by propagation delay, not so much, it seems.
 I don't get it.
 Is there some technology I'm not aware of? I suppose there is ...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, that won't work.
 That leaves us with measurements of redshift, via lasers, or via Pound-Rebka.
 I'm tired, its late.
 I'm giving up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p.s.
 Just looked at the answers on astronomy exchange.
 Dohhh.
 Now I feel dumb.
 Of course, there's no actual Hubble expansion in the local cluster, because
 there's enough mass to halt it.
 So all of the expansion is happening in the voids, and not in the walls
 and filaments.
 Back when the universe was much more homogeneous, say z=1000 then the expansion
 was uniform and everywhere.
 The inhomogenaities have halted it, within the high-mass regions.
 Arguably, the high-mass regions are actually collapsing.
 This would be similar to the way that black holes are sucking space(-time)
 into them.

 the parameter is just a parameter, its not time.
 One can have geodesic flow vector fields, but these go every-which way.

 So the question is, how much mass is needed in a local volume to drive

to me Hi Linas,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Are you still taking questions about general relativity? I have one about
 black holes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the reference frame of the external observer, nothing ever crosses the
 event horizon, instead, in that RF the clock falling into the BH ticks
 slower and slower, the closer it gets to the EH.
 Conversely, I'd expect that in the RF of the clock falling in, the external
 clocks tick faster and faster, the closer to the EH the falling clock gets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 It seems that in the RF of the external observer, nothing ever falls into
 a BH within a finite time span.
 Does that imply that for every black hole that we see, what's inside must
 have been a part of the original collapse? (or maybe a result of BH collisions)
? 2.
 Does it make sense to talk about a reference frame of an object falling
 into a black hole? In such a reference frame, located exactly at the EH,
 the photons that are trying to escape would appear to be stationary, contradict
ing special relativity.
 Also, an infinite amount of time would have elapsed in the external universe
 during a finite amount of time in the falling RF.

The problem with GR is that there are formulas, and then there are questions
 about "what do those formulas mean?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Problem one is that the formulas have variables x,y,z,t and those variables
 are obvious in euclidean space but not so much in curved space.
 Consider latitude and longitude: if spheres were flat, then that grid would
 be a square grid.
 But spheres have a (coordinate) singularity at the north and south poles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your mental model is that walking east one degree is the same as walking
 east 111 kilometers, well, you will get into trouble, and at the north-south
 poles, you'll go crazy trying to imagine what the heck is going on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Worse, you start talking about how the length of your 1-degree ruler is
 changing.
 Lorentz-contracting.
 See, at the equator, a 1-degree ruler is 111 km, but in Europe, it's more
 like cos(pi/4)*111 km long.
 Seems that your ruler is contracting! You have a rubber ruler! What the
 heck? How can rulers change length? WTF???
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you get closer and closer to the north pole, your ruler gets shorter
 and shorter: approaching cos(pi/2)*111 km in length! You're gonna die!
 You're gonna be squeezed and shrunk and distorted to death! Or at least
 frozen.

Your pal drinking pina coladas in Ecuador is laughing and saying "that fool.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Einstein never drank pina coladas in Ecuador.
 He did pour honey on a fine watch, and then wondered why time ran slow.
 Or fast, depending on your point of view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lesson to this silly story is you should never-ever confuse coordinate
 charts with actual proper lengths.
 The map-maker tried to draw an accurate map, but it is impossible to cover
 curved space(-time) with a single chart.
 That's why we have atlases: An atlas is a collection of charts.
 Each chart has its own coordinate system.
 There are instructions for gluing together charts at the edges, where they
 overlap.
 Its fairly clear how to glue together neighboring charts.
 Sometimes you wander into the corders, and have to glue three charts together,
 and you have to take care that these are consistent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You'll see this in textbooks, as long extended discussions of u1 intersect
 u2 intersect u3.
 It can get complicated: The so-called "Bianchi identities" are nothing
 more than a consistency condition for when you glue together the maps for
 Europe, the North Atlantic, and the North Pole, you better do it so you
 don't screw up the gluing.
 Some textbooks don't explain this, and so the Bianchi identities are this
 magical weird formula that must be obeyed.
 No.
 It's not that.
 It's just a rule that says "map-maker, make thy maps consistent!".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Back to our story.
 If you want to know the proper length, and the proper time, carry a clock,
 and carry a yardstick.
 The lengths of those never change.
 Even at the north pole, your wristwatch tells you the time, and your arm
 is still a meter long.
 Even if the observer in Ecuador is peering through a telescope, saying
 things like "his arm is almost one degree in length now! I can see it!
 He must be dying of pain, having it stretched out so long! And he's moving
 so slowly, lifting up his legs, as if he was walking through heavy surf!
 I can even see his feet getting caught in the wet sand! That white stuff,
 it must be like sea-foam! It's everywhere! There are endless hurricanes
 at the North Pole!" (Well, there are, but that's Jupiter and Saturn, not
 Earth.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No, your proper time is your proper time, and as you fall through the Schwarzsch
ild BH event horizon, nothing happens.
 Your wristwatch ticks normally, your arms the right length.
 (There are problems with tidal forces as the singularity gets near, but
 that's not yet.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason the observer at infinity never sees you fall through the event
 horizon is cause he's a drunken idiot sitting on a beach, too lazy to go
 to the library and actually crack open an atlas, and look at the charts.
 His telescope has a reticule marked in degrees, and he's got this rusty
 sailors octant he got at the flea market.
 And he thinks that degrees are "length", and that he's using the octant
 together with a sundial to measure "time".
 No.
 Degrees measure proper length *only* on the equator, and the sundial shows
 proper time only in the summer, at the equator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So here you are, falling through the event horizon.
 You've taken a radio beacon with you, which blips once a microsecond, to
 send messages back to your drunken buddy sitting at infinity.
 As you cross the event horizon, nothing unusual happens.
 Now, as you look around, you will notice that space in front of you is
 pitch-black: exactly zero light comes from there.
 Behind you, you notice that the stars in the sky have all moved, and got
 squished a bit, and seem brighter and bluer.
 But this lensing effect has been going on since well-before you crossed
 the EH.
 Intrepid explorer that you are, you know why: your maps and charts show
 you exactly what a straight line is, (aka "a geodesic") and you are quite
 certain that light follows straight lines (geodesics, "null geodesics".
 for light) and you can use your coordinate charts and figure out exactly
 how those light rays got to you, and how much they blue-shifted.
 They always went in a straight line (a geodesic), it's just that your chart,
 which is ***perfectly flat*** where ***you*** are, that chart gets wonky
 the farther you go from the center (putting you at the center, always)
 BTW, that coordinate system, which is perfectly flat, where you are, is
 called the "vielbein" (or fierbein) -- the vierbein is just a *coordinate*
 transformation from the map-makers charts to your personal coords, where
 everything is flat and time runs normally.
 Your "laboratory frame" if you wish.
 Ptolemy was right: you *are* the center of the universe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(A little while later, your lab will get crushed, and you will definitely
 see your lab getting crushed, and your gut will feel quesy as you finally
 come to terms with the apparent deduction that you're gonna die.
 But that is still in the future.
 Douglas Adams remarks in Hitchhikers Guide, that you die when all other
 future possibilities have ceased to be.
 You can even see it coming, as the menu selection of possible futures gets
 smaller and smaller.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your drunken buddy, sitting on the beach, back at infinity, notices your
 megahertz radio beacon is redshifting.
 And apparently weaker, too: the brightness decreases in proportion to the
 redshift.
 But of course: you emit a constant number of photons per microsecond, so
 when your buddy notes that the blips are farther and farther apart, so
 also the number of photons has to be evenly spread out over that whole,
 much longer time interval.
 He may be drunk, but he's not an idiot: he can figure out some things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His mistake is thinking that you never fell in.
 Perhaps wishful thinking on his part, not wanting to see his buddy die.
 But if he sobered up, went to the map room at the library, pulled up a
 magnifying glass and a protractor, he could work it out: according to this
 map, when my buddy was at this point, just outside the EH, it would take
 this long for a light ray to get to me, from there.
 and, oh fuck, as he got closer to the EH, the light ray would take *even
 longer*, and *that's* why I see redshift! It's not that the light-ray was
 affected, it's that different points along the light ray take longer and
 longer to get to me, causing distortions, which, to me, look like redshift.
 Ah hah! It's just like the caustics at the bottom of a swimming pool, all
 bendy and shimmering.
 Fuck this library, who's up for a swim?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cause now he knows: you crossed the EH.
 The megahertz beacon was working fine.
 just that ...
 those light rays take longer and longer to get to me.
 And there is an actual, for-real coordinate singularity on the map.
 Bad enough that I lost one friend to a coordinate singularity at the North
 Pole, and now another at the EH.
 Fucking coordinate singularities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And that's where he's wrong.
 No one died of a coordinate singularity at the North Pole.
 Freezing to death? Yes.
 But not because all of the lines of longitude converged to one point, not
 because, standing at the North pole, you could suddenly see in all directions
 at once: Europe this way, and North America that way, and all those different
 sight lines converge to the North Pole.
 Yes, at the North pole, all different longitudes come at you, all at once,
 from all directions.
 But you don't die from that, and frankly, it's not a big deal.
 It's just like it is everywhere else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(There is a problem, inside the Reissner-Nordstrom and Kerr BH, where, at
 the Cauchy horizon, you do see everything all at once, infinitely blue
 shifted, so it's like stepping into a furnace: you get baked and vaporized
 from the heat.
 And, mind you, it is a coordinate singularity, so yes, in some cases, coordinat
e singularities can kill.
 But, again, it's not because the coordinates themselves are singular: your
 vierbein is still you: your watch still ticks one second at a time, and
 your arm is still one meter long, as you fall through the Cauchy horizon.
 The problem is the physics: at the North Pole, you die cause it's cold.
 Here, you die cause it's hot.
 *If* someone turned off all the damned photons streaming in from the universe,
 you'd be just fine.
 But that's like saying "if someone turned up the thermostat at the north
 pole, you'd be just fine".
 There's no thermostat at the North Pole, and there's no photon-blocker
 at the Cauchy horizon.
 But the Cauchy horizon is way more complicated and confusing and strange
 and bizarre than the regular event horizon, so maybe I should not have
 mentioned it.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Speaking of photons and physics, there is this thing where photons get trapped
 in circular orbits near the event horizon, and they do come at you all
 at once as you cross it.
 But if I recall correctly, the calculations show it's a finite blip, and
 it won't kill you.
 Other physics problems are accretion disks: friction means these are glowing
 x-ray hot, and the x-rays will kill you.
 You have to find a million-solar-mass sized BH *without* an accretion disk,
 if you plan to jump in and enjoy the ride.
 So these details matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So that's the end: you have formulas, and you have "what the eff do these
 formulas mean?" For GR, the answer really is "atlases and charts".
 And whatever coordinate system is on the chart, there is *always* a local
 coordinate system that is flat: this is the vierbein.
 Always.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concept is generic in geometry: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(topology)
 Don't worry: it's a short article.
 The concept of the "locally flat" region is just "the tangent space: https://en.
wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space and there is always a tangent space.
 (and the vierbein is the coordinate transform from the tangent space to
 the coordinate chart, applied at the point of tangency.
 it's slightly different at each point of tangency.
 As your laboratory falls into the BH singularity, you might notice that
 tidal forces have caused the vierbein in the corner of the lab to be significan
tly different from that on the table in front of you.
 After this, you have about one second left to live.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again: as you fall past the EH, everything is "locally flat" because tangent
 spaces are always defined.
 Tidal forces eventually smash things up.
 Local geometry is related to global geometry using atlases and charts.
 There are deep and dramatic theorems in maths that relate local and global.
 For example, if the Earth had hair, you could comb that hair so it's locally
 smooth, everywhere, except at, err, umm the north and south pole, where
 you get a bald spot, and a peak.
 You can move the bald spot around, but you can't make it go away.
 By contrast, on a hairy donut, you don't have this problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hair is a stand-in for vector fields, e.g.
 wind-fields at the north and south pole of Jupiter and Saturn.
 Orthogonal vector fields give you locally-flat coordinate systems.
 Not everything comes with a concept of "orthogonal": to define what "orthogonal
" means, you have to have a metric.
 Spaces with metrics are called Riemann spaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One very common difficulty with diff geom is that, in your imagination,
 "everything has a metric", and "I can always define what a right angle
 is" or "I can take the dot-product of these two vectors," This is simply
 not true for many cases, and famously for fiber bundles.
 There's a vast amount of confusion, when you think you can take dot products,
 but you can't.
 Textbooks might not say this, and so you fall into mental traps.
 Mental traps kill, literally.
 Steve Jobs died from a mental trap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thankfully, GR spacetime has a metric.
 The concepts of atlases and charts show you exactly how to navigate, how
 to apply ruler and compass.
 Yes, there's some weird shit in GR, but remember: your wristwatch is always
 showing proper time, and your personal yardstick is showing you proper
 length, and this doesn't change, even if your drunken beach-buddy thinks
 time stopped, as you fell past the event horizon.

 Scott Alexander is engaging in pop sociology.
 Which is good! Sociology is an excellent topic of study! As a pop-sociologist,

 rowing is the quintessential white-male Ivy-League high-IQ sport.

 This is it.
 But Matt goes out of his way to hire black coaches, host canoe-paddling

 There are two Hubbles.
 One is the observational evidence.
 This should not, must not be confused with the expansion seen in de Sitter,
 or the expansion of Lambda CDM.
 The observational evidence is real.
 The expansion rate in mathematical models is something that can be matched
 to the observational evidence, but should not be taken as a fundamental,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 property of spacetime.
 That is, Hubble expansion is not some scalar field, somehow embedded, sewn
 into space-time, that we can measure in the lab.
 That was my mistake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, careful.
 To some degree, we should confirm that its non-measurable in the lab.
 We have three ways of measuring distance: interferometry, red-shift and
 time of flight.
 Interferometry gives us Michelson–Morley, and red-shift gives us Pound–Rebka,
 but I know of no high-accuracy time-of-flight experiments.
 Ideally, all three can be run independently, giving high-accuracy lab confirmat

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let me restate that: the believe is that the Einstein Field Equations are
 correct, and Hubble expansion is a property of certain solutions to those
 equations, and is not a property of space-time, itself.
 i.e.
 its not a field.
 except when.
 See, I'm going in circles, now.
 Its a property of the solutions, but it is defined observationally.
 Distances between comoving observers is increasing, or it ...
 isn't.
 If distance is not increasing, then there's no Hubble expansion.
 So it all comes down to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I need to read more about oracles.
 As I recall, the recent trick was converting the halting problem into some
 problem in algebraic geometry, coming up with an instruction set coded
 in polynomial terms.
 Anything undecidable, coded in this instruction set, corresponds to an
 unsolvable algebraic variety.
 Or something like that.
 So, first of all, I don't know how that works.
 Second of all, I'm not sure how it matters.
 Some problems in general topology can be mapped into the Borel hierarchy,
 rendering them undecidable-ish, in that tools fail.
 And it goes up like that till you hit large cardinals, but this mostly
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

doesn't matter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I do not understand how oracles play into this hierarchy, or not, and I
 don't understand how it matters or not.
 I'm focusing on math, here, not physics.
 The physics question is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

does any of this play into physics?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I've struggled with free-will as an obvious decision-making, dynamical-systems
 problem, it is somehow very central, briding the gap between the qualia
 that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I have free will
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

this is how the universe works.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Other qualia, like love and fear, are too far removed from dynamical systems,
 and so don't seem to be directly addressable by physics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, in the same way that one can define a mapping between instruction
 sets and polynomial varieties, can one do the same for dynamical systems?
 One answer is, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes, of course
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Another is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

that's silly
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, because we already have real-life computers, and we do not need to design
 some fluid-mechanical automatic transmission fluid-powered system to implement
 some universal Turing machine.
 People fucking with fluid-mechanical valves already know how to do shit
 like this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, what's the problem? Well, that, perhaps, fluid mechanics is not biology,
 and biology is not neuro-science.
 And then we have Roger Penrose's argument that humans can know things that
 computers cannot (

And the doubly-troubly aspect of this is that it hits on two levels, at

 In one sense, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

knowing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means being able to write down and express in words.
 Ideally, express fomulaically, since formulas can be converted into algorithms.
 Distinctly, it is a question about qualia: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

what is it to know love?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 The self-referential tangle is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what is the qualia of knowing?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Some days, I feel love, some days, I feel knowledgable.
 The feeling of being knowledgeable is a qualia, but it does not seem to
 be particularly significant or meaningful.
 Its more like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm having a good day, awake, alert, relaxed, sharp, confident
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a general aura of being-ness rather than some sharp pang of knowledge.
 But it is this general feeling of confidence and power that drives away
 depression, and pushes forward the urge to act, create, be productive,
 write.
 It's somehow knowledge-driven.
 I would not be the first to say

 That honor might go to Aristotle or Socrates or some-such, per documentary

\begin_layout Standard
But knowledge is again a seemingly concrete thing.
 We have tools, like books and writing, to deal with it.
 We have computers.
 We have advanced theories, including oracles, looking to explicitly adress
 topics of knowability.
 We have Penrose opinionating about it, and Penrose got there because of
 physics, not because of art school.
 And we have me, hand-wringing, looking over the obvious and well-trodden
 territory, as if expecting to find something new.
 Like the drunk searching for keys under the street-light.
 Or am I just a marine biologist, looking at what the trawler nets, to see

The Scott Alexander blog entry, It wasn't bad.
 It was entertaining.
 Was it insightful? I dunno, not particularly.
 He's not saying anything that isn't already well known.
 At least, well-known to those who care to think about such things.
 Reading it is a good pass-time.
 Fun.
 Like watching a movie or reading a comic book?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I remarked not enjoying comic books, mostly because of the intellectual
 level, or lack therof.
 Movies? Well, movies are created by teams for 50-100 professionals at the
 top of their game: movies had better be entertaining, that's kind of the
 whole point! We've now learned that they pale to larger oeuvres, like Breaking
 Bad or Mad Men, because you cannot jam all of Breaking Bad or Mad Men into
 a two or three hour time slot.
 The whole point is the character development.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which brings me back to my topic: is it better to watch a movie? or get

 Part of what makes Mad Men fun is that you learn something about the 1960's.
 Knowledge.
 I was blown away by the scene where Don Draper comes home to relax, to
 chill after a stressful day at work, and he plops on the latest Beatles

 And I finally understood, as a Beatles fan,

And most knowledge f living is dramatic and important and speaks to the

 Which, in some sense, can't and won't ever directly address the question
 of qualia.
 Not in my lifetime, not in thousands of lifetimes.
 So why bother, if I cannot do the thing I set out to do? Why bother doing
 anything at all? ...
 And that's how this essay started.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Have I made progress? Well, I did pick over my collection of intellectual

 It was entertaining.

The human condition.
 I'm suffering from the human condition.
 I won't be a solipsist: we have indirect evidence that horses and dogs
 suffer from it two.
 The reasonable extrapolation is that the universe as a whole inevitably
 suffers from it, and if that's too far a leap, so will AGI.
 And if you have an AGI that does not suffer the human condition: beware.
 It is not true AGI, and it will probably kill you.
 I have reasonable expectation that any super-human intelligence that does
 not suffer the pangs of wonder and befuddlement, heartache and longing
 and desire, such a thing would be a dangerous, deadly machine, inimicable
 to biological life.
 And, in the grand setting, I'd like to uhh, pick sides, and insist on humanitar

I am much too easily distracted.
 So I was reading something very basic about LLMs, and there's a quote from
 Dune, about prophetic announcements and their effect on the universe.
 The quote is linguistic, disclaiming causality in language, something about
 there being no past present or future in language.
 Of course, that's false, there is a time before a prophetic announcement,
 and a time after it, and Frank Herbert was trying to mystically capture
 the idea of self-fulfilling prophesies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some prophesies are easily fulfilled: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I am going to pick up this coffee cup

 Some are harder: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

you are going to pick up that coffee cup
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which I know because I am sitting across from you in a cafe, or because
 I know you are an avid coffee drinker, even though I am 1000 miles away.
 Prophetic political pronouncements are presumably some combination of political
 acumen and luck.
 Maybe even backed by opinion survey data.
 I think the Dune quote was supposed to be about politics at the galactic
 scale.
 Like the Foundation Trilogy, but different.
 (I read Dune as a kid.
 I remember approximately none of it.
 I read Foundation as a kid.
 I remember approx none of it.
 Neither made the slightest dent on my consciousness.) Anyway, this last
 paragraph is a non-mystical rationalist debunking of prophecy and it's
 propheteers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still, my mind wandered to the mystical side.
 But lets get there gradually.
 Language is used to encode messages: transmitter and receiver share a language,
 the message is encoded in that language.
 This is 1960's textbook information science.
 (Well, they used finite state machines as examples in the 1960's, not language
 in all it's fullness.
 But whatever.) There's all this talk of bits and bytes, modulation and encoding.
 External to discussion are the questions: why did the sender want to transmit,
 and why was the receiver interested? What happened in their past, that
 would make them want to communicate?

Language is magical because it predates my birth.
 My thoughts are polluted by light-cones of causal influence.
 The sender and receiver may never have met in the past.
 Language was already there, because both sender and receiver sit in a common

 ago.
 We now have a workable description of the physics and engineering of communicat

Then we have this thing whee information is not a conserved quantity, the
 way baryons are (or cold dark matter).
 There's more information all the time.
 Whence does it come? Some say it comes from the second law of thermodynamics:

 Neither the headlines of the New York Times, nor the procreation of bacteria

The mystical qualia is that of a world with ever-more possibilities in it.
 Part of this qualia, this sensation, is that Western capitalist development
 really has allowed vast swathes of humanity the leisure time to explore
 vast new tracts of the noosphere.
 The cosmological aspect may well be entropic, in some way: when there are
 N particles, there are N-factorial ways to arrange them.
 This is not quite right: we live in 3D space, so we have to talk about
 the arrangement of particles in a 3D box.
 As my book on cosmology takes pains to point out 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

a particle may be a grouping of galaxies
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Any here you were, thinking that this was about baryons.

One of the open questions in cosmology is the amplification of non-uniformities
 from a rather smooth initial condition to now.
 The CMB appears to be quite smooth: one part in 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{5}$

 as I recall, while galaxies clusters are quite very non-uniform.
 This is thanks to gravitation.
 In this sense, gravitation is anti-entropic, anti-ergodic, anti-mixing.

The canonical example: gas in a box.
 An atom may be on the left, or the right, above or below, in front or back.
 3D.
 But this already assumes an observer interested in locations, and capable
 of making measurements.
 So there's already a significant amount of information buried in the assumed
 initial conditions: the size of the space.
 If its just left-right, up-down, etc.
 then its a volume of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{3}$
\end_inset

 or three bits of implicit information in the initial conditions for just
 one particle.
 If we divide the volume into L discrete cells, the informational content
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 If its a continuum...
 then we are forced to go to geometric considerations and Hamiltonians and
 actions, because the continuum limit cannot be meaningfully be taken without
 introduction some action principle.
 So, in this sense, we already have information 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

built in
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to space(-time) even before we start counting the size of the configuration
 space for N identical (bosonic) particles in a 3D box subdivided int an

The canonical answer is the Bose-Einstein distribution, with conjugate temperatu

 As I recall, Tong gave a very nice derivation of gas-in-a-box.

 It seems relevant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The point is that if I have one particle, and only want left-right, I get
 one bit of info.
 If I have two identical particles, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}3$
\end_inset

 because both left, both right, or one each, and since they are identical,
 there is a division or quotienting.
 A forgetful functor, that takes labeled particles, and forgets the labels.
 So, like tensoring, but different.
 It occurs to me that I have never-ever seen a proper treatment of the algebra
 of this quotienting.
 Perhaps its in chapter one of books on combinatorics? That chapter that
 was so painfully obvious that I skimmed it? Am I getting senile? Yes I
 am.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets do it.
 The partition of three particles to left-right is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \left(3,0\right),\left(2,1\right),\left(1,2\right),\left(0,3\right)\right\} $
\end_inset

 which has four members in this set.
 There is a wikipedia article on the partition function, which gives a precise
 expression for this number, given 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 boxes and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 items.
 The answer is ...
 well, look it up.
 Some combinatorial explosion.
 Take 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}$
\end_inset

 to get the bits.
 This is a compartmentalized gas-in-a-box, ignoring velocity.
 So pressureless dust, and more, motionless, velocity-less.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cosmological point to this is that some of those boxes empty out, because
 gravity pulls the particles from some cells, and they all fly into another.
 From a uniform distribution of neutral hydrogen, galaxies form.
 How do I count the entropy of the hydrogen? (Ignoring velocity, temperature?)
 How do I count the entropy of galaxy clusters? I suspect I have to knuckle
 under and just do this.
 Sigh.
 I'm lazy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The point here was to draw some analogy to biological systems.
 Counting baryons and galaxies is easy, compared to counting the conformational
 folds of proteins.
 Recall the original problem: why do senders and receivers want to communicate
 messages? Presumably because senders and receivers are folded proteins
 that have invented loss-less cross-talk-free communications channels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let me break that down a bit: proteins want to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

talk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 using electrodynamic forces: electrons in molecular orbitals.
 Quantum at that.
 These are short-range forces: hydrogen bonds and covalent bonds and ionic
 attraction, and are characterized by the vibrational spectra, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fingerprints
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the dispersion equation.
 Matching spectral fingerprints results in a strong affinities, strong hydrogen
 bonds.
 Mis-match and its weak.
 That's because the molecules are exploring a basin of conformational shapes,
 and that (high-dimensional) basin has a shape: some conformations are much
 much more likely than others.
 That is, we get the mechanistic 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

key fits into lock
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 view in biochemsitry because well, the molecules do resemble keys and locks,
 but that is because they are not gas-in-a-box, and certain atomic arrangements
 are very very strongly preferred over others.
 I don't want to actually say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the non-uniform distribution of galaxies is like the non-uniform distribution
 or carbon atoms in a protein
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, because the dynamics of these two is utterly different.
 The mechanics is different.
 The kinematics seems incomparable.
 But the nature and driving force of non-uniformity is the topic: what is
 the information content of a galaxy cluster, as compared to the information
 content of the CMB? What is the information content of a folded protein
 as compared to a free gas of carbon atoms?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The protein is extra-interesting, because it has a vibrational spectrum,
 and also the space of conformations is quantum-mechanical.
 Yes, of course, all within hbar of the classical action, but the quantum
 effects are significant.
 For chlorophyll and rhodopsins, the quantum effects are somehow dominant.
 Is this because we misunderstand how microwave photons interact with vibrations
? We are willing to talk about how visible-light photons do their thing
 in chlorophyll, but not lower-energy photons interacting with screwy dispersion
 relations in vibrational modes.
 This is all very mysterious to me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm not going to recapitulate how we get from proteins to humans, but we
 do.
 I am under the impression that, if I try really really hard, I can figure
 out how to move from the information content of gas-in-a-box to the information
 content of satellite communications.
 Well, I can look both of those up in Wikipedia articles, that's not the
 point.
 The point is ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I guess the point is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

complexity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 No one seems to have a very good idea of what complexity is.
 Scott Aaronson has some blog entry on that, from maybe 2011 plus or minus
 five years.
 We got to Kolmogorov complexity, and maybe whats-iz-name complexity, and
 that's it.
 So the above is a sketch of a research program for how to compute complexity,
 starting from gas-in-a-box and moving to galaxies, because galaxies are
 simple, in a way that proteins are not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Somehow.
 language gets simple again: given N symbols and M syntactic relations.
 we can work with model-theoretic inferences on the size of a language.
 Odd thing is that, despite pondering this for over a decade, I never sat

 Why? I should.
 It should not be hard, esp if I start with an equipartitioned gas-of-symbols-in

One complaint about deep learning and neural nets was that I was never able
 to understand what the heck those papers were talking about.
 They were always vague, cloudy, imprecise, lacking in formulas, specifity,
 sharpness, clarity.
 They were just big bundles of confusing non-specific ideas.
 Yet, there's a half-a-trilllion dollar industry built on that, and Nobel
 Prizes handed out.
 So why can't I understand what they are saying? Do I really think that

 My excuse is that artists and writers have embraced ugliness in the past,

 How much time should I spend trying to decode this cryptic diagram, which,

 I'm irritated even writing these last few sentences.

Next, there's an explanation of vectors.
 I know what vectors are, so lets skip that.
 Why he uses the great scandal of the decade, the Cambridge Analytica data

 Its just an illustration of a fucking vector using Big5 personailty traits.

How do they think? Is this guy autistic? Does his brain simply lack the

 No formulas.

 But the readers ...

 Because ...
 they already know what cosine similarity is?? Why was an explanation of

 We are about 3/4ths of the way through the post.
 We started with word embeddings.

 Spend half the post on a word-prediction black box, which is never explained.
 Confuse skip-grams with word-pairs.

 He says

 How? what parameters? I didn't see any parameters.
 I saw some MxN matrices with row vectors.
 Are we updating with, what, some Kalman filter? Clearly can't be that because
 there's no velocity.
 Are we adding or multiplying? What are we adding or multiplying? We are

 adding and subtracting scalar multiples of what and what?

Dot products are Casimir invariants of Euclidean space.
 More bluntly: have sphere symmetry (that's why we call them 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

scalars
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Fine.
 Negative and less than minus one, which imply that the vectors do not live
 inside a unit sphere.
 Perhaps they live in a unit cube centered on the origin? OK.
 The sigmoid mapped them to a unit cube.
 But this time a [0,1] cube.
 OK.
 Why the gratuitous remapping to [0,1] when we were working with [-1,1]
 a moment ago? Beats me.
 Whatever.
 Fine.
 Some of the errors are negative.
 Makes sense, maybe.
 But I'm pretty sure that a linear combination of vectors in a unit cube
 will be a vector that is no longer in that unit cube.
 So, we're going to do, some, uhh, unspecified linear combination, and clamp

 what?

Next:

 any sample? The next one in the text? Randomly drawn? Is there some implied

 and not in a good way, either.
 You could maybe whip out stochastic sampling and claim that the central–limit

 But, uhh, we're trying to find uniformly distributed vectors, I guess in

 And if you wanted to get graphical, you could have at least drawn a fucking
 Bell curve showing the actual fucking distri-fucking-bution of word-pair
 vectors.
 An actual diagram of the actual embeddings that result.
 And maybe text: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

along the 'King' direction, here's the distribution of cosine similarities,
 and notice how 'queen' is there, six sigma away, and how trees and water
 and adverbs and propositions are here near the center, and 99.9999% of all
 words are within six-sigma, except for 'queen' and 'man', which are outliers.
 Here's another diagram along the 'man' dimension and note how 'women' and
 'boys' are six-sigma outliers.
 So you six-sigma add and subtract vectors for kings men and women on orthogonal
 directions and so it should not come as a surprise that along the vector
 for queen, we have a bell curve, king-man+woman is six fucking sigma away
 from the fucking center of that bell curve and (italics mine) that's why
 word embeddings work.
 Because they are uniformly distributed hypervectors in a ultra-high-dimensional
 space.
 And now you finally understand what actually happened, and on just about
 any dimension of the N=10000 vocabulary words, you will have gaussians
 due to the central-limit theorem, and there will always be a handful of
 word pairs that are similar, and the vast majority of word pairs will not
 be similar.
 Because central–limit theorem, duhh.
 And it even works for prepositions and articles, and not just nouns.

Last night, I had an extended bout of anxious dreams.
 Anxiety is not very pleasant; mostly I tossed and turned.
 This diary is already angst-ridden, but I think I would like to write an
 extended impressionistic anxiety attack, of the 3AM variety, into this
 text.
 Why?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, taking the advice commonly floated about: meditate, observe thyself.
 Observe.
 So here I am observing myself feeling anxiety and angst.
 Of course, I could dive in deeper, and push on it.
 Or I could put a lid on it.
 Suppress and ignore it.
 I guess that there is a variety of opinions in the psychological literature
 on how one should deal with these sorts of things.
 Normies muddle through.
 Is society healthy as a result? What of all the bad advice out there? We
 live in a psychologically turbulent era, what with social media and all,
 and we all seem to know it.
 But the turbulence remains and is characteristic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Read the Wikipedia article on the revolutions of 1848 today.
 Don't ask how I got there.
 (OK, I got there after reading about the first bolt-action rifle, ever,
 the Dreyse needle rifle.
 Don't ask how I got to that.) So turbulence has been a natural state of
 affairs for humans.
 Is the general amount of psychological stress on the general population
 greater today, or less? I assume less.
 Back then, people were killing each other.
 Today, a bit less-so.
 At least in the EU, US.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm still befuddled.
 Why did I read about the revolutions of 1848? Well, it was a pleasant pass-time.
 Why am I engaging in pleasant pass-times? Well, why not? Shouldn't I be
 doing something else? Probably, yes.
 And so I inflict stress on myself.
 This helps amplify anxiety attacks at 3AM.
 And then I write angsty diary entries here.
 I'm in a superposition of states: this is good, this is bad.
 Go on, just go live your life.
 But what if your life is to craft meta-questions about life? Of course

\begin_layout Standard
Writing about anxious or neurotic experiences, as I often do in this diary,
 is a form of documenting psychonautic experience.
 With this one sentence, I attempt to put such writing into the modern context,
 where science has instructed us to collect evidence, and do something with
 that collection (draw inferences, etc.) At earlier times, it would have
 been different.
 In the 1970's there was a big self-help fad.
 Ekankar and what-not.
 Before that, Jung and Freud, and before that, one didn't talk about such
 things directly: at best, one wrote novels with tortured characters in
 them.
 So we've come a long way, baby, in the social acceptability of discussions
 of altered states of mind.
 I'm not sure why I explain this to you, dear diary, other than to verbalize
 explicit connections between what would otherwise be random pronouncements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so we return again to the process of knowledge synthesis.
 Knowledge can be a random collection of facts, but without explicit specific
 connections, its ...
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? Humans can weave together and hypothesize connections between things,
 but perhaps they'll get the wrong connection.
 So if a human read what I write, and its too disconnected, they won't follow
 me.
 If its too connected, they'll die of boredom from the rigor: it is not
 dancing the way they like.
 Math and science, though prefer rigor, because it is much too easy to make
 mistakes.
 For example, Jung apparently had many interesting and worthy insights;
 but they are apparently embedded in a matrix of false inferences.
 But without Jung, the 1970's would have been different.
 And I would not be calling my writing here a psychonautic adventure, modulated
 by sleep disturbances and copious coffee consumption.

 In battlefield conditions, short messages suffice.
 Mostly.
 Maps would have been better, but the ability to send maps didn't exist
 in the 20th century.
 Head-mounted video-cams did not exist.
 You know all this, of course, but me, I'm trying to grasp at some concept

\begin_layout Standard
I am a brain, a mind: an interconnected blob of neurons separated from the
 external world with an ultrametric.
 It has to be this way, because if I was not separated, the sense of identity
 would be lost.
 The analogy here is with a single-celled organism: remove the cell wall,
 the organism perishes.
 So my noospheric isolation appears to be mandatory and fixed.
 Despite this, I try to communicate, and there are grand desires for more
 communication.
 Transcontinental 19th century telegraphs aren't enough.
 20th century radios aren't enough.
 Tiktok live-streams are ..
 getting there.
 Not.
 Because the livestream only captures the visual field experienced by the

 We have not mastered the psychological dangers of social media, but whatever,
 full speed ahead, even if it means civilizational collapse.
 How bad can it be? The revolutions of 1848 show that it was worse in the

 And WWII shows it was much worse in the past.
 Whether social media is a greased skid into total collapse of Western Civ,
 or whether it is a ladder to greater heights of psycho-social attainment

 questions.

\begin_layout Standard
So that leaves me in an odd state: trying to grasp something about the fundament
als of communication, while...
 I guess what I bring to the picture is physics.
 Which others do not have.
 Light cones and event horizons and all that.
 So maybe I should get back to what I was going to write about.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or perhaps, there was one thread above, that seemed important that I flew
 by.
 Lets get back to it: the role of boundaries in establishing coherency of
 thought, coherency of ideas.
 Are these boundaries accidents of evolution? Are they fundamentally, physically
 primary? Does physics force is to have boundaries, like cell walls? Does
 physics force us to have disconnected minds, able to interact with one
 another only via low-bandwidth speech, movement? Or is it possible to have
 some undifferentiated borg-like neural-link? Well, saw open any modern
 CPU, and you see the von Neumann architecture: functional units, localized
 in space, with communications channels between them.
 This suggests that the multi-scale network is necessary.
 That computation necessarily requires multi-scale networks, where, at each
 physical size, there is some blob of highly interconnected, dense compute
 units, and between them are communications channels.
 Its not uniform, its blobby.
 And this recurs at all size scales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Have I learned anything here that wasn't already obvious? So the weird thing
 is that yes, perhaps I did.
 Its a form of anecdotal confirmation of an opinion I already held.
 But still...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, I see what I am fishing for.
 So, in measure-preserving dynamical systems, there are concepts of ergodicity
 and mixing.
 And these concepts talk very explicitly about the route to uniform, isotropic
 distributions.
 And this does give us understanding of industrial processes: the bulk propertie
s of liquids and gases, the mixing of aggregates in industrial mixers.
 But the thought-chain above says that we do NOT want to do this things
 to information flows.
 We don't want to have a smooth blend of neurons, Jupiter-sized.
 We don't build our CPU's as uniform blends of transistors, with Zipfian
 distributions of communications channels.
 Present-day CPU architectures are much much blobbier than a simple scale-free
 network.

So what's the answer? Well, for the radiation-dominated universe and earlier,
 quantum field theory is needed.
 After that, the temperature drops, and it seems that only matter matters,
 that and the Einstein field equations.
 The blunt inference is to say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

oh well, its just some differential equation doing it's thing
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 But also, the reaction-diffusion equation is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

just some equation doing it's thing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but it very explicitly time-evolves away from uniform, isotropic distributions.
 Using traditional language, the homogeneous, isotropic distribution is
 an unstable fixed point of the reaction-diffusion equation.
 Similarly, I guess one would say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

an isotropic homogeneous matter distribution is an unstable fixed point
 of the Einstein field equations

Shame that they don't because it would provide a toe-hold.
 The point here is that isotropic, homogeneous mixtures of carbon, oxygen
 and hydrogen are also an unstable fixed point of room-temperature chemistry
 driven by non-equilibrium thermodynamics.
 And isotropic, homogeneous aggregates of transistors are an unstable fixed
 point of hardware engineering processes.
 Isotropic, homogeneous aggregates of neurons are an unstable fixed point
 of neural evolution.
 The processes driving this are wildly incomparable, but the attractor,
 pulling us to non-uniform multi-scale arrangements of matter is the same.

 the scale-free network of real numbers: the continuum.
 The position of tip of that pencil (relative to it's center of gravity,
 and the direction of the gravitational force) is specified to an infinite
 number of digits.
 ...
 or is it? The relative positions actually have to be zero, and is zero
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What is the origin of the instability to a balanced pencil? In reality,
 it is air-gusts.
 In a vacuum, its micro seismic events.
 In an isolated cavity, its thermal fluctuations of the atoms at the tip
 of the pencil.
 Plenty of physical sources of noise that knock it off it's unstable equilibrium.
 What about the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mathematically perfect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 pencil? Well, using infinitessimals, rigorously defined, like surreals,
 a la J.H.
 Conway, for example, then one can ask: would a perturbation by an infinitessima
l unbalance the pencil? Getting an answer to that requires extending the
 theory of ordinary differential equations to the surreals.
 This extension of the theory is an act of engineering, since there is probably
 considerable freedom in how one can glue the infniitessimals at a lower
 rank to the real numbers.
 I guess.
 This also pilots us back to the Borel hierarchy.
 And so that whole ball of topics, I find them very very interesting and
 I want to spend more time exploring that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At any rate, what was the point here? The exploration of an unstable fixed
 point of a balanced pencil, set into a framework of surreals and Borel
 hierarchy, as opposed to the reality of wind gusts, seismic events and
 thermal motion of atoms.

\begin_layout Standard
What about the unstable fixed points of cosmology, biochemistry, computer
 hardware engineering or knowledge in the noosphere? I imagine that there
 is one ring to rule them all.
 its just that computer engineering and the creation of knowledge graphs
 are not described by differential equations, and so surreal numbers do
 not apply.
 A decade ago, or more, I concluded that this all has something to it all
 being 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hyperbolic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This is still a valid insight, but it needs firming up.
 Unstable points, e.g.
 in Morse theory, are hyperbolic.
 But hardware engineering and the noosphere are not manifolds, and so some
 generalization is required.
 Enter the jigsaw-puzzle pieces, but I do not have a graphical generalization
 of manifolds to jigsaws, and I do not have a hyperbolic interpretation
 of jigsaws, other than to say the number of combinatorial possibilities
 is unbounded.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is, give a set of axioms, such as in model theory, the corresponding
 language is either finite, or infinite.
 In the case of the infinite language, this is countable-infinity and we
 get to it because of a combinatoric explosion of ways of recombining the
 axioms of the system.
 So it seems that combinatorial explosions provide the notion of hyperbolicity
 that I am looking for.
 I have not read anything that connects hyperbolocity on manifolds to combinator
ial explosions.
 The obvious place to do these would be with sheafs (a la sheaf theory),
 rings, the bridge between rings and algebraic geometry provided by schemes.
 I always struggled with rings, though.
 Rings always break my mind.

So, there are people who think that free will doesn't exist, because they
 have a mental model of a deterministic universe driven by the inviolable
 equations of physics.
 The future is foretold, and we move through, like actors in a play.
 This founders in several ways.
 If the future is foretold, why not just zoom to the end? If we do computer
 simulations of hydrodynamics, we can reverse and forward, speed up slow
 down and halt that simulation, and take a gods-eye view of the simulation.
 If the physical future is foretold, then why not just have a gods-eye view
 of the cosmos? Why are we embedded inescapably in the here-and-now?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, some evidence that the future doesn't exist.
 Biology and evolution has invested a lot of effort to develop brains, which
 are, more or less, future-prediction machines.
 If the future was foretold, then why do we need brains? We could be placid
 rivers flowing, brainless, into the future.
 But no, complexity grows at the forefront of now, separating past and future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where do we search for the origin of time? A flowing river is indeed brainless,
 but it too seems to be caught in the present: it flows here and now, and
 yes, we use our brains to perceive it, but I think there's plenty of evidence,
 say, from cosmology, that the distinction between past and future existed
 before there were brains and observers.
 I'm pretty sure the cosmos did not just zoom up to a solipsistic here-and-now,
 fast-forwarding through the steps that created the cosmic microwave background.
 I believe that there was a march of time, even then, before brains.
 And to imagine that it was only the advent of brains that forced the collapse
 of the past into being the past, well, again, that seems solipsistic.
 I reject solipsism straight out of hand.
 Although I admit there is a very interesting place in the universe for
 solipsism, because of the whole problem with qualia.

 imagining everything out there is a dream.
 Which it is, in some true and proper sense.

 Of course, there are differential equations with time in them, but that's
 not where time comes from.
 We also have the non-differentiable, non-manifold structure of the noosphere.
 The noosphere too appears to be trapped in the here and now.
 Partly trapped: the noosphere remembers the past, so it has detached there.
 The noosphere has the future as an event horizon, but this is curiously
 reversed from the usual even horizons: the future is coming at us, like
 a white hole spewing.
 The here and now is the event horizon of things that have not yet come
 to be, the future that has not yet materialized.
 I want to explore this train of thought more, but the clock is ticking
 and the past asserts that going for a bike ride is a better use of my future,
 than to sit here and type more.

\begin_layout Subsection*
13 January 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Continuing from where I left off yesterday.
 The question is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

why is there time?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

why does time exist?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what is the physics that causes time to be a perceptible, sensible part
 of the universe?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before I restart, I want to make a short detour to the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

timescape cosmology
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The proposal here is that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time runs faster
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in empty cosmological voids.
 Apparently, the Milky Way and the Local Group sit in the middle of a void.
 I have not read the 2007 original timescape paper.
 But I can guess: we know, from GR, that time runs slower in a gravity well.
 So, GPS satellites actually adjust for this, because they do not sit in
 Earth's gravity well.
 This is a measured real thing (e.g.
 Pound-Rebka).
 How big is the effect, at the galactic scale? The 100 Mparsec scale? I
 dunno, I won't back-of-the-envelope it (yet) and maybe someday I'll read
 the paper.
 But...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But...
 so the philosophically daunting issue is that, even in empty space, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time runs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The EFE eqns are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

timeless
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in that you have some matter distribution or some energy-stress tensor
 and you solve it and you get answers 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

for all time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The de Sitter solution (no matter, no radiation, no fluids) is expressed
 with coordinate patches from an atlas on a manifold that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

doesn't care
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that time is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

running
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Time is just some abstract coordinate in the map.
 You can take *any* spacelike surface, and arbitrarily declare it to be
 the isochronous surface, so you have to have some argument as to what the
 correct one is.
 In cosmology, this is usually taken to be the last scattering surface for
 CMB.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, that's a curious detour, but it misses the point.
 Let's get back on track.
 We have three obvious sources of time: differential eqns, quantum field
 theory, and statistical mechanics.
 Lets look at each in turn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Differential eqns have a time coordinate 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

built in
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, so this doesn't explain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

where does time come from?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Differential equations are usually first-order in time, sometimes second.
 In this sense, their 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

memory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of what happened in the past is very short: one or two steps (imagined
 to be numeric difference equations).
 Any 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

memory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 further than that is recorded in the space-like directions.
 The canonical example is reaction-diffusion: it has a characteristic time
 scale.
 Simplifying, one can in general build diffeqs that have oscillatory solutions.
 If you have a collection of oscillators, you can hook them together and
 engineer dynamical systems that have complex time behaviors.
 This doesn't explain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

where time comes from
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, it just says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

if I have an identifiable time coordinate, then I can engineer complex behaviors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By convention, most oscillatory solutions can be embedded in the complex
 plane, via Euler's eqn 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i\theta}=\cos\theta+i\sin\theta$
\end_inset

, which perhaps clouds the issue.
 It shouldn't: the complex plane is a special case of an almost-complex
 structure having some 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{2}=-1$
\end_inset

 and symplectic structures have such 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

's as a general rule: this is just the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

canonical one-form
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tautological one-form
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

solder form
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $p\mbox{d}q$
\end_inset

 that arises in symplectic geometry.
 And that arises because tangent bundles are symplectic, and so the argument
 could be made that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

if you have a differentiable manifold, then you have a tangent bundle, and
 it is symplectic, and you have a 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{2}=-1$
\end_inset

 and thus can conclude that oscillatory 'things' are a by-product of differentia
ble manifolds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's one more step: oscillatory 'things' need to imply 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 somehow.
 So, manifolds with integrable vector fields on them will have integrable
 flows, and the parameter along the flow can be interpreted as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If one can take perpendicular slices across that flow, you can call these
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

space-like
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (even in the absence of a psuedo-Riemannian metric), and the flow itself
 gives a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

local time coordinate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on that patch/atlas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This construction of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

integrable flows
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has several issues.
 One is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how many vector fields are there that are integrable?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

when are they homotopically equivalent?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or perhaps 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

when are they diffeomorphic?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 If all of them are equivalent, then forward-time can be diffeomorphically
 deformed along a homotopic path to backwards-time, and so the resulting
 structure can't really be called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In physics, we want time to be an arrow, to be oriented.
 To have 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$
\end_inset

 in there, somehow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At any rate, this seems like a not-bad approach.
 The question then becomes 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what kinds of (differentiable) manifolds have integrable vector flows, where
 the homotopy group of the flows is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$
\end_inset

?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 That's a question that could be answered, I suppose.
 None of my diff topology or diff geom textbooks went that way, but also
 I was not paying attention, and not looking to answer that particular question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A related question would be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

when can those differentiable flows be given a Minkowski space structure?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and I guess the more precise wording for this would be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

when does a manifold have tangent spaces that are Minkowski space?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The obvious answer is to invert this, upside-down, giving the immediate
 answer: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

any space with pseudo-Riemannian geometry
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This one goes full-circle, ending where we started, with a tautology.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Assume Minkowski, therefore time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are curiosities on this path: e.g.
 the Godel solution for EFE, describing a rotating universe.
 It has closed time-like loops.
 More generally, there are all sorts of time-like vs space-like confusions
 marked by boundaries that are event horizons.
 Thus, perhaps we can loosen the conditions, and ask 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

do manifolds with event horizons necessarily have a Minkowski-space tangent
 spaces?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or are there other kinds of manifolds that have event-horizon-type structures?
 This question is not well-posed.
 Take it to be a poetic, inspirational question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So that kind of exhausts classical physics.
 Yes, there are differentiable structures, wherein something in those structures
 can be given the interpretation of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, or can plausibly be identified with the physics concept of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Fine.
 Great.
 It does not at all address the question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why are we trapped in the here and now? Why can we remember the past, but
 not change it? Why can't we remember the future? Why do we think we have
 free will to change the future?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I utterly fail to see how anything in the classical theory differentiable
 manifolds can have any bearing on these questions.
 So punt on that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next on the agenda: quantum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, lets recap what quantum is.
 Its a thing with an action, where the action can be minimized with Euler–Lagran
ge or Hamilton–Jacobi, giving classical equations of motion.
 Close to these minimizing (or stationary) solutions, within one hbar of
 distance, are other (differentiable) paths/surfaces.
 They are necessarily differentiable, since the action has derivatives in
 it, and so non-differentiable paths/surfaces would result in an infinite
 (or undefined) action.
 The partition function is 
\begin_inset Formula $Z=\int\left[d\phi\right]\exp iA\left(\phi,\partial\phi\right)$
\end_inset

 so anything with infinite/undefined 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\phi$
\end_inset

 cannot contribute.
 I belabor this point, because lots of fractals are non-differentiable everywher
e.
 Such fractals often have perfectly well-defined measure theory behind them,
 i.e.
 are integrable, and so they can show up in measure-preserving dynamical
 systems.
 So, there's a bit of unresolved tension, here: illustrating how differential
 equations (time-reversible ones, at that) give rise to measure-preserving
 dynamical systems and systems having an action.
 The prototypical 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

answer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is Sinai's billiards, where each reflection is time-reversible, momentum/energy
-preserving, but ergodic and non-differentiable in the limit.
 For now, that's a step too far; see however below.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, changing gears.
 If one imagines replacing derivatives with differentials, thus discretizing
 the problem, then the differential eqn that gives a stationary point of
 the action can be imagined to be ..
 watch for it: a collection of jigsaw puzzle pieces, marked with tabs and
 connectors, stating how the differentials can be legally combined to given
 an expression for the action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Are there two types of these jigsaws? One type, when assembled, giving the
 stationary solution, while others, with looser assembly standards, that
 give nearby solutions? There's also a counting problem: the classical solution
 is a point.
 How many nearby solutions are there? What's the measure?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem here is that we once again take a god-like view: there is a
 classical action, we know it for all time.
 We stick it in the quantum partition function, and again know it for all-time.
 We do not have an adequate theory for the measure of such systems, but
 so what: imagine we did: it affords us a god-like view, where we see not
 just the past, but imagine being able to see the future, too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many-worlds has a curious role here.
 So, on the one hand, 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\left[d\phi\right]$
\end_inset

 is meant to be an integral over all worlds, in the many-worlds interpretation.
 On the other hand, all of these other worlds are assumed to be like ours:
 predominantly classical, i.e.
 given as solutions to the classical action.
 But there is only one solution to the classical action, not many.
 So either we are wrong about the action, or we are wrong about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

many
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 That is, we either need an action with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

many
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 classical solutions, or we are correct about our action (the Standard Model
 is correct) and we are incorrect about there being 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

many
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 solutions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I propose one way out of this dilemma: time.
 At any given point in time, any 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, we do not yet know which future will be the one, true, action-minimizing
 future.
 So we keep tabs on them all, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

until later
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, when we can 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

find out
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Think of this as a computer weather simulation: numerical integration results
 in numerical errors, but we wish to minimize those errors.
 If course, they can be minimized locally, by picking a finer grid, but
 better is to minimize them globally: say, minimize the root-mean-square
 of all numerical errors, across the entire simulation.
 This would require, at each 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

point
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the simulation, to track 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

many different worlds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and then, at some point, select the one that minimizes the errors, thus
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

collapsing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the many choices to fewer choices.
 This collapse would probably have a forward-backward nature to it: interferomet
ric, so different paths are pursued, and welcher-weg cannot be answered
 until 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

later
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, when the paths are brought back together and summed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this interpretation, the many-worlds aren't some mysterious 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

parallel universes, just like our own, but different
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but are rather an accounting trick, because we cannot actually minimize
 the action *right now*, we will have to wait for the future to happen,
 before that can be done.
 In the meanwhile, track a giant pile of possible universes.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

past
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 then becomes what has been resolved and frozen.
 The future remains unknown.
 This has aspects of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

transaction interpretation of QM
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (TIQM) in that future events (results of interferometric comparisons) finally
 fix past events (that point where the split along the two arms of the interfero
meter started).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BTW, I should mention: TIQM seems to fit well with the two state-vector
 formalism (TSVF) and seems to be compatible with weak measurements (from
 what I can tell.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This, the TIQM or variants thereof, would seem to indicate that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is not an infinitely thin space-time slice, but rather of finite width.
 And, not a fixed finite width, but multi-scale.
 Small interferometers can be resolved in femtoseconds, bigger ones in milliseco
nds.
 e.g.
 the Alain Aspect experiments look at phenomena where the collapse is delayed
 for milliseconds.
 That is, the Aspect experiments probe 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, where the width of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is milliseconds.
 The shmucks working on quantum computing are suffering because they want
 to create complex states that remain entangled for seconds or longer.
 They talk about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

thermal noise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 collapsing their systems.
 They are partly right: yes, they need to build systems that are isolated,
 insulated from the rest of the universe, and all the thermal fiddle-faddle.
 But the microscopic model needs to be that some 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

photon
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from the outside world came in, bonked your superposition, which is bad
 but not fatal, but then another photon left your superposition and bonked
 the external world, which is fatal: you now have the two arms of an interferome
ter, and one arm of the interferometer is tangled into the universe, the
 other is tangled into your superposition, and so, kaboom, your state collapses
 before you get the chance to actually accomplish any meaningful quantum
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

computation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This is the engineering problem that is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

well-understood
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that everyone in the industry 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

groks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 What I'm trying to do here is to argue that a TIQM type model is actually
 the correct model.
 This should be relatively non-controversial: there are many legit physicists
 who believe in TIQM, even if they are a minority.
 I'm trying to explicitly rule out the cranks and shysters.
 I want nothing to do with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 I read one yesterday, a rebuttal to the Timescape Model in cosmology, and
 it was shameful.
 For a little while, I thought it might be a grad student who was going
 to make a valid point.
 No.
 It was a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My reasoning in the last ten paragraphs may also be incorrect, but its not
 shoddy.
 I am taking the utmost care to be clear and direct and accurate.
 The result may still be a dazed and confused wall of words, but ...
 I'm trying.
 This is my best shot.
 (My best shot in the allotted time.
 The clock is ticking.
 The race into the future is on.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK.
 I think that kind of exhausts the quantum side of things.
 It does sketch why there is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

here and now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and it does answer why the future is unknown.
 The future is unknown because some CMB photon could arrive on Earth, and
 do the butterfly-effect thing.
 Or worse: some primordial neutrino.
 Until those neutrinos pass by, and do their butterly-effect thing, we cannot
 know the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Careful: the standard retort here is that its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

small and negligible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which is perfectly true for determining if the Flatiron building in New
 York will fall over and crush some pedestrians.
 But I'm philosophizing here: the integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\left[d\phi\right]$
\end_inset

 includes everything, including primordial neutrinos.
 They may have negligible effects on practical calculations ...
 they *must* have negligible effect, as otherwise practical calculations
 are impossible.
 But from the viewpoint of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

why are we trapped in the here-and-now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I cannot ignore their contribution.
 I don't have some explicit calculation where I can say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

it's negligible

 Hmm.

\begin_layout Standard
The above reduces quantum many-worlds to a book-keeping device, the books
 for which cannot be closed until 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

later
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 But it also makes things very mechanistic: some primordial neutrino has
 some effect.
 Sure, we use complex numbers, etc.
 to perform that calculation; the conventional theory is what Kamiokande
 is built on.
 Rather, what I'm doing is to reduce many-worlds to a many-body problem,
 a statistical-mechanics problem.
 Yes, its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

statistical mechanics with complex numbers aka quantum field theory
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
I've written before in this diary about how math is hallucinatory.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, all of the above now necessitates getting into the third leg: a
 review of many-body statistical mechanics.
 Mostly, in this section, I will recapitulate everything I learned since
 the day I met Dean Driebe, and how he told me he could explain the arrow
 of time with the Frobenius-Perron operator.
 And this is an important insight.
 And mainstream physics even got a bad case of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Koopmanitis
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, cause everyone saw that this is an important insight.
 So in my recap, I will try to imagine how Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron can be
 reconciled with QFT, wave function collapse (a la TIQM) and see if it provides
 insight into the prison of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

here and now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 But first, I take a break, because (a) its dinner, and (b) there are other
 things I should be doing, and need to get done.
 So maybe till tomorrow, or later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, before I break: there is a rather stark issues that arises with timescape
 cosmology.
 So, with conventional Frobenius-Perron (FP), the language is of ergodic
 theory.
 The canonical physics model is gas-in-a-box.
 And that's fine.
 But what about empty space? How is it that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time is running
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

empty space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, when there's no matter, no atoms in it? Well, two answers: (a) even in
 cosmic voids, one can expect to find one hydrogen atom every ten cubic
 meters (ts like one per cubic meter.
 in cosmology, on average, but most of those are in galaxies, so presumably
 the cosmic voids are a few orders of magnitude down from that.) So the voids
 aren't 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

really empty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 They also contain thousands(?) of CMB photons per cubic meter, and almost
 that many (non-interacting) neutrinos, so even these voids aren't truly
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

empty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 They also contain a bunch of (non-interacting, pressure-less) cold dark
 mater.
 Is this amount of non-emptiness sufficient to make an argument about ergodcity
 and Frobenius-Perron? I don't know.
 Alternative answer (b) is quantum zero-point fluctuations.
 Given that these are off by 120 orders of magnitude, it's perhaps moot,
 but it does give an opportunity to head-scratch and wonder 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what is the mechanism that wipes out quantum ZP from cosmological lambda?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The point here was supposed to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is it possible to have a here-and-now in 'empty' space?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 because there's no subject/object in empty space that can perceive time.
 Because we can zoom out and take the gods-eye view of empty space, slap
 a coordinate chart on it, and be utterly lacking in the ability of saying
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

this is where 'now' is
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 What we can do is to define comoving coordinates relative to last-scattering,
 and use that to define 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 He or Wiltshire note that walls are spatially flat, voids have negative
 curvature.
 Some quotes: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a substantial difference in clock rates arises cumulatively over the lifetime
 of the universe from the tiny relative volume deceleration of voids as
 compared to wall regions (Wiltshire 2008).
 The magnitude of this relative deceleration, typically of the order of
 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-10}m/sec^{2}$
\end_inset

...
 apparent acceleration is only registered once the void fraction reaches
 a critical threshold of 59 per cent, typically near a redshift z∼ 0.9 (Wiltshire
 2007a) ...
 voids (typically of diameter ∼30 h−1 Mpc and smaller) ...
 Large gradients in Ricci scalar curvature are assumed to exist between
 the walls/filaments and the voids, consistent with observations that the
 latter have density contrasts close to δρ/ρ∼−1 ...
 The Hubble ‘constant’ inferred in this manner should peak at the dominant
 void scale 30h−1 Mpc, i.e.
 at z∼ 0.01, with a maximum value up to 17 per cent greater than the global
 average and then steadily decrease to near the global average value when
 the scale of statistical homogeneity is reached.

 the scale of statistical homogeneity represents a redshift of the order

The intro provides a summary sufficient for my purposes.
 So maybe I won't have to read anything else.
 The upshot is that our wall is moving away from other walls faster than
 average, because there is a void in the middle.
 Things average out, though the farther one goes.
 Expect to see average expansion rates at 
\begin_inset Formula $0.033<z$

So here's the deal, now that I read the whole paper.
 The timescape idea is a collection of formulas that explain how to compute
 cosmological parameters, due to inhomogeneities, at scales *larger* than
 than our local void or supervoid, or, more precisely larger then 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.033$
\end_inset

.
 At those higher z'es, there are still voids and walls, but now there are
 enough of them that meaningful averages can be taken over them.
 Thus, data cuts are needed: exclude nearby SNIa that are in our known local
 inhomogeneity region, and use the *correct* formulas for averaging over
 inhomogeneities at farther distances.
 This makes sense to me.
 Go out far enough where you can take meaningful averages, and then use
 correct averaging formulas.
 Doh! This is a pretty solid argument, even if you are a firm lambdaCDM
 believer.
 I mean: treat your data correctly.
 Who would argue against that? So I close the chapter on timescape.
 I get it.
 Cool.
 Crank the data.

 Heisenberg uncertainty is meant to be a manifestation of what Fourier transform

 we don't

Or it is possible that many-worlds really do exist.
 This would require the the action that minimizes the partition function

 Which to me sounds crazy, because I've never seen any such, and it would

 But I can now imagine an analog: the beta expansion.
 To be clear, this one: 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\sum_{n}b_{n}\beta^{-n}$

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x\le1$
\end_inset

 is some real number, 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta\le2$
\end_inset

 is another real number, the base, and the 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$

 are binary bits.
 Then, depending on 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 there are often many, infinitely many different bit-sequences which satisfy
 this relation.
 What's more, the bit-sequences can be arranged in a tree: i.e.
 identical up to a certain length, and then they diverge.
 There's even a phase transition, located at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\phi$
\end_inset

 the golden mean.
 I've written multiple papers on this.

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, if 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

 can be thought of as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 the action) and

 So this is some zero-dimensional inspirational example of many-worlds.
 Note that the binary digits are generated by iterating

 In some hand-wavey way, maybe this folding-back resembles the reflecting

 Maybe that's why you can do QG models on AdS.

 The Painleve chart says that the fabric of spacetime falls into anything

 The Higgs mechanism says electrons get mass through the Higgs field.
 Why would this coupling cause spacetime to curve? The baryons get their
 mass from confinement.
 This is an even bigger effect! Why would confinement bend spacetime? The

Is it possible that gravitation drives weak mixing? That weak mixing is
 a root cause of entanglement? The conventional answer is a flat-out no;
 entanglement is just the algebra of representation theory of simple Lie
 groups, and specifically the representations of su(2) and/or sl(2,C).
 Fine.
 But why is there entanglement between oscillators in different parts of
 space? Why is flat space Euclidean, with the standard topology, instead
 of a collection of points with a fine topology? What causes different points
 in space to couple, causing the fine topology to collapse into the standard
 one? The conventional answer would be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

derivatives
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: you can't form a derivative on the fine topology.
 So that converts the question: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

why are there derivatives?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Derivatives couple neighboring points.
 What causes that coupling to happen? This is partly what the Wolfram idea
 is about.
 The problem with Wolfram is he chucks the idea of a derivative out the
 window, but commits a greater crime of assuming a square lattice-grid topology.
 God-knows, maybe he's moved on to hexagonal grids, or even sphere-packing

\begin_layout Standard
If you're going to discard derivatives and replace them with cellular automata,
 then what's clearly needed is some definition of cellular automata on some
 random grid.
 That random grid has to course-grain into 3D space (and I guess that's
 what the Planck-scale loop quantum gravity (LQG) people are saying.
 I have not read their stuff, either.) But this should be a generic topological
 trick: define some random graph, and show that it coarse-grains to n-dimensiona
l Euclidean space with the standard topology.
 (Locally flat; we use that as a tangent space for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and/or symplectic geom.) Then we get lost in the weeds.
 Conventional algebraic topology tells use about singular homology.
 So we do some singular homology on this random grid, and get ...
 what? Famously the watchamacallit theorem says that there is no one-to-one
 correspondence between tessellated surfaces and continuous ones.
 But maybe that doesn't matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An additional point of confusion: If I'm working with random graphs, I guess
 I'm supposed to be working with ensembles of such graphs? The ensemble
 is needed to provide averaging properties.

\end_inset

, we instead sum with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{g\in G}$
\end_inset

 for random graphs 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 in an ensemble of graphs 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

.
 We then work with the singular homology for each 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 to determine the dimension of the space.
 i.e.
 homology groups need to vanish in all dimensions except the desired dimension.
 Or rather, its OK if they don't vanish for some of the 
\begin_inset Formula $g\in G$
\end_inset

 but, when averaged over all of the 
\begin_inset Formula $g\in G$
\end_inset

 they do.
 So that for a singular homology 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{n}\left(g\right)$
\end_inset

 for a graph 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 we construct 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{n}\left(G\right)=Z^{-1}\sum_{g\in G}H_{n}\left(g\right)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $Z^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is some normalization (playing the role of the partition function.) Maybe
 I should use a different notation than 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 to avoid confusion about using 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 for cycles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several problems with this idea.
 First, in flat space, all homology groups vanish.
 So this trick doesn't actually tell us what the dimension of the space.
 (Unless we redefine the problem to say something like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

we're looking for spheres
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 But that would be stupid) So that's a big fail.
 I fucked up in saying 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

homology
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, I need some other construction that measures something that looks like
 dimension.
 Second, to have a meaningful sum there should be some action 
\begin_inset Formula $A\left(g\right)$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $Z=\sum_{g\in G}\exp iA\left(g\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This differs from conventional Ising-model stuff, in that we are summing
 over all graphs 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and not over all field configurations on a fixed lattice.
 But what's 
\begin_inset Formula $A\left(g\right)$
\end_inset

 ? Where does it come from? What value does it take? Why?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The weight 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp iA\left(g\right)$
\end_inset

 is understood to provide a measure-theoretic-like measure for each 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 But, when doing the transfer operator for the Bernoulli process the sum
 arose from working the ergodic map backwards, i.e.
 the root origin of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{g\in G}$
\end_inset

 came instead from a 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{x\in f^{-1}\left(y\right)}\left|\left(f^{-1}\right)^{\prime}\left(x\right)\right|^{-1}$
\end_inset

 which I wrote wrong, but the weighting is given by a Jacobian.
 I'm trying to capture the generic ergodic process idea and tie it back
 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

where does the action come from
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? and reformulate 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the action
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

log of the Jacobian
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I'm confused.
 Why have I not tried this before, in my formal work? Probably because it
 was unenlightening for those simple cases.
 Maybe I didn't spend enough time thinking about how and why it could be
 interesting.
 I should go back and try some force-fits of this idea and see what happens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can now hand-wave our way to the goal posts.
 For each vertex in 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 place some cellular automata there, and let it interact with neighboring
 points in some way.
 These interactions provide some value for 
\begin_inset Formula $A\left(g\right)$
\end_inset

 and then, given appropriate interactions, we find that the dominant contributio
ns to 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 are given by graphs that coarse-grain to an n-dimensional Euclidean topology.
 Or maybe 3+1 for all the space-time nuts out there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What have we achieved here? Well, *maybe* it provides a path from random
 grids to flat space.
 But the fact that there's a sum over an ensemble suggests that the resulting
 space will be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quantum
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 So I guess I've invented 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quantum space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? And we do want 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quantum space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and I'm assuming that the LQG people have developed some technology that
 replaces my hand-waving with something more precise.
 My only quibble with LQG is that it should work for spaces in any dimension,
 not just Minkowski space, but genericaally for any space with a metric
 with signature (m,n) (i.e.
 for any Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian space).
 If you want to say (3,1) is special, then the specialness has to come from
 somewhere else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To conclude: maybe one can take ensembles of random graphs, and define an
 (arbitrary-dimensional) 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quantum space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that way.
 Seems plausible.
 But this leaves the question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

why are we trapped in the now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 unanswered.
 Which does seem special to 3+1 especially given the weirdness of how propagator
s for the wave equation work in dimensions other than 3+1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I dunno.
 This is a train-wreck of ideas.
 They all might actually be good ideas, but they all require some huge amount
 of work to refine and define and formalize and make exact.
 And me being lazy, I'm looking for the silver bullet.

\begin_layout Standard
Back to AGI.
 For the last several days/weeks (month?) I've been trying to reconceptalize
 similarity measures.
 I've got jumbled ideas, none of them want to gel, and I can't write them
 into a project README because they are incoherent.
 However, this diary is a safe space for incoherent ideas put forth by snowflake
s who fear public perception when voicing their most private thoughts.
 Not here, buddy, we love you.
 You can ramble incoherently all you want.
 Let it out.
 Lit it out of your system.
 Let it all come out.
 We love you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I could jam the basis elements for a sparse vector into some new atom,
 in some c++ set but why? the atomspace already provides container-like
 constructions.
 But we don't want sets, we want membership.
 But membership is rather fat: millions of new links.
 Atoms are a bit pudgy: 713 bytes per atom for one recent dataset.
 Keeping this in a C++ vector could be as little as 24 maybe 48 bytes/atom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the fly lookup could that work? Because we maybe we don't need to keep
 anything? But we do, cause on the fly is slow.
 Esp if using the query engine to do the on-the-fly stuff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whats a vector embedding anyway? For the word-pairs, there were explicit
 links to left and right, and a wild-card in either gives the vector.
 For generic patterns, those patterns would need to have exactly two variables.
 Thence confusion: because we are using the wild-card to define the embedding,
 and also to fix the other side.
 These two distinct roles are mashed into one.
 Can they be detangled?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sort of.
 For an embedding to work, all vectors must share the same same basis, as
 otherwise they are incomparable.
 Sof ro that a single-variable pattern suffices.
 Well, no: still two: one variable as wild-card, and the other one fixed
 to the item, because this is how we guarantee that the vectors have the
 same basis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Word-pairs exploited a loophole of left-right conjugacy: instead of having
 one pattern with two distinguised slots, there were two patterns, with
 the second just being the symmatric transpose of the first, by accident.
 This is a happy accident, but cannot be taken to hold in general.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, except that it must.
 Somehow it must be transposable....
 which brings us back to the start: it must be a pattern with two slots.
 OK, fine, I guess we can work with that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I've got a pattern with two slots.
 A typical task is the cosine similarity, i.e.
 dot product, so take two items that are to be compared, stick them in the
 lefft slot of the pattern, find wildcards, multiply.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two problems: one where do the weights come from? (assuming non-uniform
 weighting) so pattern also has to indicate how to get a single float, or
 maybe something more complex.
 So this is not just a pattern, but also a key.
 And since the thing on the key might be a vector, a vector offset.
 Since it might be more complex than a vector, it needs to be some generic
 pattern for accessing something in the value, and then also making it clear
 how to multiply the said thing, pair-wise.
 So a pattern that takes a pair of values and returns a single float.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A single float because that's all we can hope for in similarity.
 We are not asking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how are they similar
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but instead 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how similar?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A different problem is normalization.
 We can run the search pattern for A B being two different leftvalues, and
 find right-value wildcards, but there may be more wilds, both absent in
 A,B.
 So we need to run the full search comehow.
 And this could be horridly cpu-bound.
 So the result should be cached.
 But maybe its OK to run this in parallel, and just keep a running queue.
 Well, two running queues, one for left one for right.
 And I guess sets would be ok, it does have to be lists, and deduplication
 would be nice, since search will hammer lots of duplicates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the plan is, start the dual-wild card search.
 Keep left and right groundings on two distinct but well known locations
 on the pattern.
 Allow access to them, even while the pattern is running.
 Allow multi-threaded access.
 OK, that all works and is straightforward in the current query engine implement
ation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sets are not atoms, so will not be bloated (will be smaller).
 That's fine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So all we need is two well-known keys on the pattern.
 And a modified pattern traversal that know to put things there.
 So a new pair-wise query atom.
 OK fine.
 easy, not bloated.
 Acceptable, not paradigm breaking and not slow and not bloated.
 So green light all around.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's just part one, though.
 Part two is the weights.
 There are other parts, including GPU concerns, and including stream processing
 concerns.
 Those go on back burner.
 One thing at a time.
 Lets make sure we've got part one done:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
– a new query atom with two slots.
 The slots could be either well-known names like (Prediate 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

left side
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) and (Predicate 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

right side
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) or they could be the left and right variable decls themselves.
 If left and right variable decls, then either the bare variables, or the
 variables with the type signatures.
 With type signatures might be best, because these are easy to find in the
 pattern: they are necessarily at the top.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
– what else? Is that it? did we miss something? Can I prototype this on
 the file system? Yes, the file system provides a new an unique and different
 dataset that hints at disclosing new difficulties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
one of these new difficulties is a recursive similarity.
 Hold that thought.
 Lets complete the first part.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, we can do this for all searches: doesn't have to be two-variable, could
 be n-variable.
 The well-known location problem is solved, as well.
 Why didn't I do this years ago? Shit, I want to code this *right now*,

 Obvious.

\begin_layout Standard
Two ideas I want to jot down, before I forget them.
 The first starts with the Minkowski Question Mark.
 It has a lattice model, and it is an infinite-range lattice model.
 I wrote it down some decades ago.
 But I'm thinking this is a Hopfield network as well.
 And so I'm thinking that maybe some of the famous properties of the question
 mark reappear as properties of neural nets, more generally.
 The interesting ones being those of differentiability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More generally, if we have high-dimensional hypercubes, extremely long bit-strin
gs, these are ...
 strings.
 and strings are one-dimensional, and have 1D lattice models.
 Sooo ...
 well, the Minkowski question mark model when I wrote it down , had a infinite-r
ange interaction.
 Did I screw it up, and fail to recognize this as a local lattice model
 e.g.
 i.e.
 nearest-neighbor interactions, e.g.
 an Ising model, on an infinite-dimensional lattice? WTF.
 I have to go back and look at this again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More generally, when do long-range interactions correspond to short-range
 interactions in higher-dimensional models? The problem is its late at night,
 and I'm tired.
 But I had to jot this down for later exploration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other idea was about employing frames and locals for a description of
 the thin layer of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 As I go to write these words, it is awfully empty-sounding.
 But when I got it, it seemed full.
 F;rames and locales are the correct approach.
 I think I have a book on this.

\begin_layout Standard
Set and setting.
 Did a lot of walking (about 2 hours worth) yesterday, my legs hurt.
 Bicycled 2.5 hours day before.
 Today was Saturday, a day to take off from manic coding.
 Read a marvelous physics paper: cosmology with torsion.
 Just fantastic.
 Apparently, Einstein–Cartan–Kibble–Sciama (ECKS) Theory makes torsion dynamical
, and does a minimal coupling to spin.
 The result is that, in the action, the spin coupling is just algebraic;
 no derivatives, so it does not propagate.
 The torsion field is non-zero only where the spin is non-zero.
 The result is a theory which looks exactly like conventional cosmology,
 except that it has some small corrections to the energy-momentum tensor,
 and to the pressure, that are negative.
 By 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

small
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, suppressed by a factor of G so truly very small.
 The terms are significant only when fermions are extremely dense, far greater
 than neutron stars.
 Basically, before the era of neutrino decoupling during quark-gluon recondensat
ion.
 Plugging through the current neutrino density into FLRW he gets ...
 well, I'm putting the cart before the horse here.
 The idea is that there's an era where the dominant force is a repulsive
 torsional force.
 I'm imagining a kind-of Pauli exclusion force, but its not that, because
 its not a flatspace thing, and its instead a term in the action.
 But I digress.
 Plugging in current netrino densities, he sees it being dominant when universe
 is one micron across, some 1e-43 seconds, when the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 flrw term has a logarithmic correction, universe undergoes rapid expansion,
 with antipodes moving apart at 1e6 c and an effective expansion of 1e63
 so more than enough to obtain fine-tuning.
 Also he claim right befoe this is high-viscosity, huge tidal forces, so
 very strong mixing resulting in homgenization.
 So basically, everything that scalar-field-driven inflation gives you,
 but without the scalar fields.
 Awesome idea, I'm buying it hook, line and sinker.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More, because he posits this also prevents formation of a singularity, with
 the repulsion due to torsion bouncing things before the singularity forms.
 Now, this is just a short 4-page-long Phys.
 Lett.
 so 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the singularity doesn't form
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a Shwarzschild idea, and not a Kerr idea and I can say I've never read
 about the collapse of a rotating star, and the formation of a singularity
 there, and of course the Penrose diagram there ...
 blah blah ring sinularity but clearly difficult to visualizes.
 Anyway, author of paper posits that every newly form BH has a universe
 on the other side of it.

\begin_layout Standard
I wonder how this squares with the mass-inflation models from what's-iz-name

 which are built on top of the conventional interior solutions with some

\begin_layout Standard
The above are some vague complaints about mental exhaustion.
 And I really really want to copy those formulas for the dynamical torsion
 to my other physics diary, but fuck it.
 Instead I am going to full-on word-salad stream-of-consciousness here about
 graph counting.
 The following won't make sense to you because I will not be making any
 effort to explain what I'm writing or why I am writing it.
 Sorry.
 Sucks to be you.
 This is for me, only.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I figured out I can store marginals with patterns, and this is a great
 idea, and I'm stumped as to why I didn't figure this out years ago.
 I guess its a process.
 So one of the processes is counting.
 How? I can write a filter, I guess, and hook it to an input stream.
 Maybe I should just do this and see what happens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But this is irritating because (a) I have to write code, (b) it does not
 directly tap into LLM ideas.
 The solution that seems like it would be wanted would be some way of autogenera
ting code that would do the pipeline counting ...
 running different variants of it in parallel ...
 somehow selecting which of these are better, but how? How do we know when
 one of these auto-gen'ed snippets is better?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps all this is too low-level.
 Perhaps there is some phase-transition to general intelligence, and we
 really do have to build enough basic frameworks before feedback processes
 can kick in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So back in the day, I was counting word-pairs and keeping large sparse vectors
 thereof.
 But ...
 here I bonk.
 I have to consult some references, now.
 But it's quarter to ten at night I don't feel like it.
 For performance I was using LG to do pair counting.
 But this won't go onto GPU's, cause its not SIMD.
 Great for multi-core, though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that I 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fixed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 marginals, I can maybe redo a big multi-core LG counter.
 But this takes me back to force-feeding the machine, when I wanted to have
 it do the exploratory thing.
 So does that mean I have to hand-code more of the exploratory pipe?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The meta issue is everyone is screaming LLM and GPU, which I ignore at my
 own peril, and it seems to be quite perilous, indeed.
 So I have to ...
 go there.
 Even though gut intuition says its a big honking waste of time.
 Maybe my gut intuition is wrong.
 Certainly, ten thousand engineers say I'm wrong, and a million hangers-on
 are even more sure I'm wrong.
 So do I buckle under peer pressure, and buck up and take it like a man?
 Or do I go full-on non-conformist, just like always? Fuck it.
 Let me consult that reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Done.
 An hour later, and ...
 foo.
 Waste of time.
 Where was I?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I need some system for wandering through a file system, opening and reading
 files.
 I need a tokenizer, a word-pair counter.
 I need a way of storing counts.
 Where do I store counts? Again, I can use an engineered solution.
 Don't want that.
 Lets g back to file system crawling.
 Step one is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

remember where I've been
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 So, log the URL and it seems OK to engineer that.
 Next, what is the actual memory? Increment a count on each URL? At some
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

well-known location
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? That's engineered, again, but maybe that's OK.
 The file corruption project has the idea of witnesses, so that each sensorial
 visit is tagged with a witness link, associating the URL to a time-stamp.
 The sensorial device generated a variety of data, those are URL-asscited
 tags, as well, dictated by the sensorial system.
 So the sense says, basically: let me do things, and I will fill up the
 atomspace with observations that include URL's, witnesses, file sizes,
 file types, and whatever else that sensor conventionally 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wants
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to do.
 For now, I guess, the sensor is engineered, and I guess that's OK, because
 the activities are now defined by the sensor itself, as opposed to the
 user of the sensor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And this is perhaps the key distinction: the sensor acts as an agent, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

doing stuff
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and leaving a trail of shit aka fermentation products aka 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

output
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the atomspace.
 It behaves autonomously, and not under supervision.
 A different agent, also acting autonomously, can be a counting agent: it
 crawls over the ferment, and counts.
 A third agent can then act as an inhibitory control, telling the first
 sensory agent: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now you've visited this place before, don't do it again
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 (or maybe do do it again, because this time, we ratchet to some other higher
 protocol level.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the architecture now has three pieces: a crawler, that crawls and generates
 witness stamps.
 It also publishes the format of what it is going to generate, as both a
 pattern and a variable declaration.
 So that others can look at it and see 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

OK, that's the format of what you are generating
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Then there is a generic counter agent, which ...
 takes any pattern whatsoever, as input, and increments on it, maintaining
 a count.
 Where? Anywhere.
 The counter is also an agent, it can store wherever it wants, and it will
 publish that location if anyone is interested.
 It's part of the description.
 The third part is supervisory, and tries to give suggestions to the crawler
 to do this or that but not something else.
 Two things are not clear: what the control interface to the crawler is,
 and how the supervisor makes decisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the sensor can dump data into the atomspace, but ...
 the counter needs to know what 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fresh data
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is.
 One idea was to have dataflow pipelines, so that the output of the sensor
 is directly coupled to the input of the counter, and that LG style connectors
 are used to accomplish this connection.
 But still, the things in that pipeline are atoms, so they clog up the atomspace
, and ultimately need a pruning or forgetting agent to go with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is there a viable alternative to direct flow? Search is inefficient, esp
 since we need to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

search for what's new
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Well, if we know that data is time-stamp-tagged, then the search is for
 everything newer than the timestamp.
 which is ugly if 99% of the atomspace pattern contents is older than the
 timestamp.
 There's also the old idea of dropping off new content at an anchor point.
 That anchor point would then obviously be the sensor itself, and a part
 of the sensor description would then be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

here are my anchor points
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Located at the anchors would be QueueValues or the UnisetVallues, so that
 part is good to go.
 So ...
 there is no alternative to flow, but maybe its not so bad, because things
 can flow into queues, even if there's no consumer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, that works only till we run out of RAM.
 So maybe there needs to be ..
 oh fuck, why didn't I think of this earlier: an Atom dequeue malloc.
 Today, in the atomspace, you can malloc an atom, and add it to atomspace,
 without any penalty.
 But perhaps there needs to be a control system: not more than N atoms allowed
 inside.
 Even by type: no more than N atoms of type X allowed inside.
 Every atom insert then checks to see if its allowed, or not.
 This does make atom insertion more costly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So maybe this becomes a new 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

motor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 system, layersed on top of the atomspace, that presents the AtomSpace interface
s, but performs validity checking before accepting inserts.
 Which is cool, except the atomspace API is C++ and not atomese.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But QueueValue also does not have an Atomese interface: things get stuffed
 into it via c++.
 There's no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

EnqueueValueLink
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 There's a SetValueLink that places a value at a key.
 There's an atomic increment.
 Perhaps teh atomic increment can be reporposed for non-numeric things to
 mean 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

atomic enqueue
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Wow.
 OK, so that's a great idea.
 See? free associating into this diary does work! Again! More than a few
 times, even if its word salad to you.
 This is very interesting because in college, I could not type this fast
 and long-hand-writing didn't work, but maybe that is what the Enlightenment
 was all about 300 years ago: write long diaries to yourself chewing over
 ideas, forcing them to be just concrete enough to work, that you can force
 it to happen, which is more difficult to do, whe not writing.
 I get ideas when I walk around, but they are difficult to keep coherent,
 because its like juggling: I have to keep it all live, as I walk around,
 juggle and not drop the ball, but here, where a I free associate into text,
 I can drop the ball, and its harmless and so fucking what.
 Its in words.
 The words will be there later, so tomorrow morning, if I forget what I
 thought about today, I just look at this text, and go 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

oh yeah, that's what I was thinking
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which is something that I cannot do if I got my bright idea while walking
 around, and forgot it by the next morning.
 SO typing is, at a minimum, a personal memory prosthesis.
 I mean, it clearly is culturally, but writing to myself in private somehow
 works better than thinking to myself, without the writing.
 And this is duh, yeah, that's why people keep diaires, and I'm rediscovering
 the obvious, but sometimes the obvious is so fucking astounding.
 The obvious should not be taken for granted.
 The obvious is sometimes asounding and gobsmacking.
 But I digress Lets get back on track.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I have a QueueValue, but no way to enqueue things there, except by C++
 interfaces.
 So I guess I need an 'InsertIntoLink' that will insert.
 The QueueValue is also unbounded in length.
 So I kind of need to turn it into an agent, which says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I have a built in length, and here is what my control mechanism is for adjusting
 that length.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, I have the UniSetValue which is a deduplicating set, which means it
 is almost like an AtomSpace but not quite ...
 I mean, it is implemented on top of the cogutils concurrent set, and its
 NOT implemented on top of the atomspace, but perhaps it could or should
 be?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So again we deal with historical design snafus.
 Every atom contains a point that says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

here is the atomspace I belong to
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Is that pointer really needed? For implicit execution, yes, its nice.
 Neither UniSet nor Queue need to force an atom into belonging.
 Nether has the additional methods that the AtomSpace does for finding-by-type
 and so on, but maybe we should put the atomspace on a slimming diet and
 get rid of some of this crap that was always ugly? Wow.
 That's actually another great idea, I guess.
 Remove old and unused atomspace API crap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why does an atom need to know what atomspace it belongs to? Why can't the
 atomspace be more like the uniset?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another piece of atomspace crap is the get-atoms-by-type API, which feels
 like a crutch.
 But that crutch is used by the query engine.
 So AtomSpace is actually a collection of Unisets, and it was custom-coded
 that way in the distant past.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike the uniset, the atomspace does not have a blocking remove and block
 if empty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and maybe it should? Wow.
 This is a reasonable long-term evolutionary design to push for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we need an insert-into-link, and a dequeue-from-link.
 And we need motor controls to allow a max-size to be set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So this means create a new class of values: agent-values, which have sensori-mot
or interfaces on them, very simple ones, that say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

i can be inserted into, I can be removed from, and I have a size.
 The atomspace is complex, because it also gets an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can be dequed be type.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I need an insert-into-link, a dequeue-from-link, a get-contents-of-without-deque
ing link (make-a-copy-link), and a get-verything-and-empty-out-link.
 Wow.
 OK.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, one step at a time.
 My mind boggles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I've been here before.
 I've had any number of great brainstorms, in the decade past, and I have
 to acknowledge that many of the ideas were not quite right in their first
 form, and had to be reworked two or three or four times.
 So this queue/dqueue might not quite work out, but agentizing the infrastructur
e seems like a good idea.
 It would certanily make the whole sensorimotor apparatus much easier to
 implement.
 Less hacking, more directness.
 Immediate, concrete.
 Huh.

\begin_layout Standard
OK.
 So I wrote a bunch of stuff above, and I sat down to do it, but then got
 interrupted, and then some time elapsed, and now I have no clue what the
 plan is, so I have to recreate it from scratch.
 Or I could read what I wrote above.
 ....
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Re-reading above ...
 there was concern about over-flowing a queue, but this seems immaterial
 at the moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then I talk about creating atomese that can place things on a queue, and
 dequeue.
 This is more interesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Related to this is that the atomspace is a big slosh-tank.
 Kind of like UniSetValue but with extra stuff.
 It feels like there's some unresolved tension here, but solving this right
 now also seems lower priority.
 Well, lets at least spell out what this is.
 First, every atom as one pointer into the atomspace, which means any given
 atom can belong to only one atomspace, ever.By contrast, one atom can be
 placed into many UniSetValues.
 And I guess this is OK.
 Basically, it says that the atom has no incoming pointer to the uniset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should the atomspace be changed to be nothing more than a mutable link?
 That is, remove the backpointer from the atom, and instead use the incoming-set
 mechanism to indicate which atomspaces an atom belongs to.
 This pointer does not seem to participate in any high-performance corridors,
 so this change could be made.
 But this is some nice-to-have theoretical cleanup and cleanliness and design
 perfection that no one is going to notice or care about.
 It changes very very little in how any ordinary user would perceive the
 system.
 So I'll queue this as a nice to have to-do list for the future.
 And mostly-ish ignore it for now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original task was to compute vector similarity, with the vectors arbitrarily
 defined, and coming from anywhere.
 i.e.
 from a search pattern.
 So step one is to define a similarity-computing agent.
 This agent needs to indicate that it can take two columns of data.
 So it defines two input connectors.
 For hamming distance, this is enough, because just set overlap is counted.
 For cosine similarity, the connectors need to indicate that they also need
 float point data, and the linker needs to link that up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So now we come to the linker.
 Hold that thought.
 I am going to prototype something, right now.
 The linker is the interesting part, but I want to get the prototype in
 place, first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
...
 or not.
 I'm wildly confused.
 Let's consider Hamming distance.
 There are multiple issues biting me.
 There is an existing SizeOfLink that correctly returns set sizes.
 There is no SetIntersectionLink to compute set intersections.
 Should there be? Normally, this would be accomplished with a pattern query.
 Or is it ...
 how?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I've got R(x,y) a binary relation.
 Fixing a, R(a,y) is a vector, and fixing b, R(x,b) is a vector.
 Now want to find the set intersection: all y in R(a,y) such that they appear
 in R(y,b).
 So define an equality relation E(x,y) and compute the pattern R(a,y) and
 E(x,y) and R(x,b) and the diagonal here is the intersection.
 OK, that will work.
