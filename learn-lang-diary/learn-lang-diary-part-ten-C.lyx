\begin_layout Title
Diary - Part Ten-C
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
January 2025 – present
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepštas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Unlike parts one through nine in this series, this one is not really about
 the language-learning effort.
 It is instead a private diary; a continuation of Part Ten-B, which got
 over-long.
 It is not curated for human consumption; I am making the assumption that
 no human being will ever actually read this.
 Thus, its filled with random stuff I feel like writing.
 Some of it is very personal, some of it is nonsense.
 Mostly, I am finding that the act of writing helps otherwise vague and
 scattered thoughts quantum-collapse into a more coherent form, where I
 can examine them, like a dead butterfly pinned down in a display case.
 Dead words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Human readers are discouraged from reading this, on the grounds that there
 are probably better uses of your time, than to sync your thought-patterns
 onto mine own.
 Live your life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part Ten already got an introduction.
 How many more do you want?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
29 December 2024
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's a good time to start afresh.
 In short – dafuq am I doing? I seem to be going at max RPM in first gear.
 Is this supposed to be fun? I'm burning out writing the Atomese sensori-motor
 code.
 In the previous diary entry, I convinced myself that this was not a totally
 stupid idea.
 Now, I am not so sure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the early visions for Atomese was to create affordances suitable
 for algorithmic boostrapping.
 This is a nice vision, but perhaps a mistake – and on multiple levels,
 a mistake.
 Perhaps I got lost in the details.
 The details are a vision of computing from 100 years ago: that lambda calculus
 can say anything sayable.
 Updated to more modern time, we find that lambda calculs is the internal
 language of Cartesian Closed Categories.
 These are big words, and the bigness of them is beguiling, and I think
 lie at the heart of the mistake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thanks to my physics/math background, it was very natural for me to dive
 deeply into the microscopic details of structural atoms.
 Perhaps one of my finest acheivements is coming to an understanding that
 jigsaw pieces are perhaps an ideal structural element.
 Jigsaw can be used to build anything.
 They are more naturally expressive than lambdas, and have natural identificatio
n with tensors (and the many-world parallelisms of tensors).
 Making them ideal for Bayesian priors, and other many-choice settings.
 They have natural interpretation as graphs.
 But they're typed, and so carry significant information (having significant
 information content.) And I didn't invent them.
 Many other have invented and reinvented them, over the decades.
 So, all around goodness.
 So why am I crying? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, if the goal is to build AGI ...
 well, if jigsaws are like atoms (like literally, cehmical atoms) I'm daydreamin
g of creating biology from them.
 Well, that's nuts: biomolecules have millios of atoms (daltons, or whatever).
 I'm not gonna get there.
 I might discover some cute low-level assemblies.
 But that's it.
 Not scalable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, second example.
 It's like day-dreaming of building a computer from individual transistors.
 Of course, this has been done, but it took decades and tens of thousands
 of engineers.
 There's pretty much exactly zero infrastructure for working with jigsaws.
 Like just about none at all.
 So I'm at square one.
 No one is interested, no one is helping.
 Basically, it won't happen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, third example.
 It's like day-dreaming of building a neural net out of individual neurons.
 Oh wait ...
 well, again, this has happened.
 Again, this took decades and tens of thousands of academics, grad students,
 engineers, tinkerers of all kinds.
 So, yes, neural nets all start with a single sum and a single sigmoid,
 but the scaling is the result of a massive engineering effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I think jigsaws are as promising as any of these things, as a basic, basal,
 low-level self-assembling structural component.
 Its just that ...
 I'm at square one, and no one shares my vision.
 So its not going anywhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What to do? Well, the lesson to be taken from LLM's or, perhaps, Microsoft
 Copilot, is that the world is filled with human affordances.
 At this stage, in the early 21st century, it is easier to build neural
 nets that can work with the available human affordances, such as coding
 in java or python or whatever, than it is to create this assembly-like
 intermediate language I call 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Atomese
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Atomese was meant to make it esy for machines.
 But it starts at such a low level, that leveraging up seems single-handedly
 impossible.
 Just teach the computer to code in python, and be done with it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hah.
 And there's the rub.
 Current state of the art in neural nets suggests that they'll never be
 able to arrive at the abstractions needed for doing the kind of reification
 that humans natrually do.
 So licking back and waiting for AI to magically learn how to program seems
 ...
 well, it renders me into an observer, rather than participant.
 I'd rather participate, for now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So what can I grasp at, what can I do, to be effective? Well, I've got several
 more visions.
 I articulated them on the opencog wiki in the last few days, and also in
 a readme file somewhere.
 But again – they're visions, and from what I can tell, visions shared by
 no one, so I'm like – roll up your sleeves, and get to work, you dog.
 This leads to a feeling of hopelessness.
 I burn out from going max RPM in first gear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What should I do instead? When I ask this question explicitly, I rapidly
 get to the general perception of well, I can rattle off all the social,
 psychological, cultural, political, economic activities that humans engage
 in, and they are so varied.
 Somehow, being a medical doctor is worthier than sitting around doing cross-wor
ds all day.
 or being a junkie.
 Western culture got that part right.
 But perhaps medical doctors burn out: there's always one more patient to
 treat.
 So, me here: there's always one more technical paper to read, one more
 line of code to write.
 Max RPM in first gear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current Western-civ definition of shifting into higher gear is to garner
 money, power, fame, influence.
 Gaining any of those takes effort and talent, and like any human activities,
 take decades to hone one's skills.
 And as that is done, I read less papers.
 Perhaps this should be like atheltics: don't overtrain one muscle group,
 while leaving others atrophied? I've let my power, fame, money and influence
 atrophy.
 And now here I am, wimpering like the old man that I am, that my ethereal
 being hurts.
 The physical therapist suggests some simple exercises for the weak and
 dibilitated: pay the bills, read the email.
 Like any ordinary person recuperating frome an injury, taking the doctors
 advice is hard.
 I don't want to go out and exercise, to go out and exercise and gain the
 strength so I can go to the olympics of wealth, fame and power.
 Unh, unh.
 Cause people do what they want to do, and I am a person.
 Perhaps whats-hisname from Star Wars could say

, but well, dafuq.
 I can force myself to ride a bike up that hill in Southern Walnut Creek
 bike trail.
 I can force myself to do what it takes to win gold medals at the US masters
 nationals.
 I do NOT have to force myself to read textbooks on general relativity or
 string theory, because I find that actuall fun.
 I do have to force myself to pay the blls and read the emails, cause that's
 not fun.
 Or something.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I feel like I am procrastinating.
 And, well, I am.
 Because the duties that I shirk do not provide the dopamine reward that
 I've grown accustomed to.
 I'm a goddamn dope addict, addicted to reading math textbooks, instead
 of doing whatever the fuck I should be doing.
 Crap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Worse: I engage in activities without asessing the worthiness of those activites.
 Like I spent a month hacking on the 25th anniversary edition of Bigfoot.
 (the i370 code base.) Its useless, cause no one but no one except maybe
 Paul Edwards, and even then that;s a maybe ...
 no one will ever use it and no one will ever care.
 I might as well have spent the month doing crossword puzzles, or mainlining
 heroin, or something.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was one minor utility: in the back of my mind, I got to review the
 landscape of operating system technology, from assemblers and compilers
 to kernels, and file systems and containers.
 It lead to my playing with Ceph, so now I've got my home cloud.
 And its interesting to see how Ceph is multi-machine autonomous in a way
 that single-machine OS'es are not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which brings me back to where I started: my current path of tinkering with
 Atomese is not going to recreate Ceph in my lifetime.
 So I'm torn.
 One part of me rests completely assured that million-dimensional vectors
 of jigsaws are absolutely the correct approach.
 Another part of me is repelled by the daunting task of taking the next
 steps.
 Or mis-steps, as they may be.
 A third part of me laments my wasted youth.
 A fourth part of me is more than happy to also waste my waning years.
 A fifth part of me is deluded into thinking that perhaps by verbalizing
 into this diary, something will happen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But is 10PM Sunday night, and I'm tired.
 I think I will go do something relaxing.
 I think I will got read more of David Tong's Cosmology.
 It's a nice treatment.
 I'd never really seen a decent treatment of FLRW before.
 It's not super-complex; the lectures are aimed at undergrads.
 But they're focused, concise, clear, well-written.
 Unlike a lot of crap I read.
 Why can't people write? I wonder if I can write.
 I think I can, but no one reads what i write, so maybe my topics, my style,
 the things I have to say just aren't, well, they're just not Kardashian
 enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With that, good night, adieu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Big Think.
 Somehow, for decades, longer, since college, before, I've avoided actually
 thinking about the 
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

big question
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: what is AGI, really? I'm going to avoid it a bit more, with a few paragraphs
 of autobiography.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I remember the first time I built something.
 I stacked two blocks, one on top of another, and they didn't fall down.
 I got to three even, but could not move past that.
 Mother had gone shopping, I guess, and left my sister and I in the basement.
 The basement was kind of a safe space: nothing there, no way to escape,
 nothing to break, no way to get hurt, warm.
 I must have been four.
 My sister is a year and a half younger, I think she was sitting, crawling.
 I tried to show her how amazing it is to stack blocks, but she seemed disintere
sted.
 I think I even got her to stack two.
 No more.
 Actually, I think I got maybe five high.
 There were arch components, and a big trangular block, for a Roman forum
 look.
 I might have stacked two columns, and put that on top.
 See, I don't clearly remember that any more, I remember the thrill of getting
 to three, and once that was mastered, the rest was down-hill.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I remember what the basement looked like.
 Grey enamel floor.
 Stairs in the center, no railings.
 Work-bench to one side, open space to the other, and then the furnace room.
 I could draw a plan, right now; I remember it photographically.
 Well, I did spend a lot of time down there.
 79th and Justine, Chicago, Illinois.
 I remember a lot of that interior.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I remember the day I learned to read.
 Fox in Sox.
 Doctor Suess.
 Mom had a record of that, vinyl LP.
 She put it on.
 Somewhere in the middle, I realized that the words I was hearing corellated
 with the symbols aka words on the page.
 Put it on again, from the beginning.
 Sure enough! The first 3,6,9,12 words correlate perfectly! The first two
 or three pages are similar, having similar arrangements of words, but subtley
 different, and from those subtle differences, I could tell that the spoken
 words started on page one, and not on page two or three.
 That they were in order, and not backwards order, or jumbled.
 The were perfectly synced, and started at the begining.
 I got so busy verifying the correlations on the first three pages, that
 I lost track on page four.
 No matter.
 Start it again.
 Yes, they correlation between sound and words persists through page five.
 I form a hypothesis: I bet it works that way, to the end of the book (which
 seems impossibly long, but there we go...) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I remember explicitly formulating this hypothesis.
 Of making this prediction.
 Prediction is the wrong word.
 Nor was it an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a ha
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 moment.
 I mean it was, but more like, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gee, I bet this goes on to the end
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Not betting with money, but more concretely: if I were to listen to the
 sounds again, they would match the words.
 The ability to listen to sounds again was unquestionable, a subconscious
 given, not available for analysis.
 Ditto the looking at the pages of the book.
 These were not topics of awareness.
 What was in the awareness was that if the actions were repeated, the correlatio
ns would persist.
 Perhaps inference is the right word.
 Prediction is the act of seeing something (visually) and knowing what will
 happen next (in time).
 But this correlation was not in time or space, it was abstract.
 Thus, I was not predicting anything.
 Rather, I made the inference that the sounds and the words are corellated.
 On the third or fourth listen I got maybe ten pages in, to the part

Knox in sox on fox in box.
 With a paddle.
 On a noodle eating poodle.
 ...

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I got tangled up in there.
 I think my Mom didn't want to listen to it one more time, so that was it
 for the day.
 I got to finish the book, and eventually memorize it, over the next week.
 But that was it, that is how I learned to read.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A very conscious process, with explicit conscious formulation of hypothesis.
 Starting with a dawning awareness of correlations, the game was on: a sleuthing
, a analyszing a detective mystery: if we go back, and play the record again,
 then the words wer correlate, and they will do so exactly, and not just
 in some impressionistic form, but precisely.
 All this was in my conscious awareness: that it could have been merely
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

close and suggestive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and my hypothesis was that, no, it would not be just 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

suggestive of
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but that it would be exact.
 I was very concerned with lacunae.
 What if the spoken word skipped over pages? I paid attention to flipping
 the age: that the sounds, the spoken words, would correlate with what was
 non the next page, not skipping a word or two, not sliding in some syllables
 that preserved the beat and rhyme, but failed to actually correlate with
 what was printed on the page.
 All this was in my explicit consciouss awareness.
 You, dear reader, mught think I am confabuating, but I am not.
 This is what my memory functions recorded of the incident.
 They recorded the process of awning awareness, the inference, the hypothesis
 formulation, the explicit formulation of multiple competing hyopthesis
 (that the correlation was poor, inexact, skipped over words...) the surmise,
 surmission, that the correlation would be exact.
 The hope that it would be exact.
 Lurking in the back was even a sense of disappointment: if the spoken words
 failed to correlate with the text, I would be disappointed.
 A grand insight would be dashed.
 Reality would be random and vague and blurry.
 I wanted it to be sharp.
 I hoped it would be sharp.
 This is the emotional side.
 My memories do a poor job of recording emotions, but in this case, I know
 for sure that it would have been a disappointment, if the words didn't
 correlate, and that this sleuthing adventure would be quickly abandoned,
 and forgotten, if this was not the case.
 I had better things to do with my time, than to listen to some artistic
 impressionistic verbal recital that vaguely dealt with the same topics
 as the written book.
 I mean, that was fun and OK-ish, but definitely weak sauce.
 I could do something else.
 Like maybe wander into the living room, or something.
 There were lots of other interesting things to do.
 Crawl under the table, or something.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, I remember the floor plan.
 Visually.
 The radio, Blaupunkt.
 The record-player, in a cabinet above, a cabinet my father had made as
 a college design project.
 We still have it.
 It's up in the attic now.
 The aluminum legs are not quite strong enough to bear the weight.
 Its modern.
 It looks like a Mondrain painting, but furniture.
 Three open bays, a fourth bay with a black formica door.
 But I wander off-topic.
 Of course, everyone remembers many things, for may different reasons, in
 many different ways, in all sorts of different abstraction settings, with
 different kinds of focus on what was important, and what wasn't.
 Some people are ruled emotionally much more; others are analytic.
 I suppose I have to class myself on the analytic side.
 But I'm also normal.
 I'm good with the visual arts.
 I like music, I could play guitar.
 I like sports.
 Socializing with other people is my weak spot; I don't do much of this.
 i think my parents are partly responsible.
 They knew I was smart, and they very much did not want me to hang out with
 other kids, or, at least, other kids who were not Lithuanian.
 SO I got Audrius as a good freind.
 Audrius was not a genius.
 But I digress; this is not meant to be about my childhood, but about AGI.
 So, lets get back on track.
 and that means more autobiography, before I tackle AGI head-on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My aunt taught me how to read.
 Aunt Irena.
 When my parents vistied, she gave me and my sister some Donald Duck comic
 books to look over.
 She had quite the collection.
 (She also had first editions of Ancient Greek poetry, Sophocles, or something
 like that.
 She loved to read.
 I have a photo of here, knee-deep in Lake Michigan, with two other freinds,
 holding a book up.
 In water, Wth freinds.
 Books don't go into lakes, with water and freinds.
 But this is my Aunt Irena.
 So...) Anyway, so my uncle walks in, and catches us red-handed: we are merely
 looking at the pictures, and not actually reading the text.
 And it is clarified that at least I know how to read.
 My sister, maybe not quite yet.
 Unclear.
 But me, I can read, and my uncle is demanding in that way: you will submit
 a book report.
 You will read this, and next time I see you, you will submit a book report.
 This is the kind of threatening demands he would make.
 Take fun things and turn them into not-fun.
 My aunt intervenes, I think.
 She's much more gentle.
 She says, dont grill them.
 Never mind him.
 It's OK.
 But you really should read the words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And they're right.
 When you read the words to a Donald Duck comic book, the story really has
 nothing at all to do with what you imagined it was about.
 It's completely and totally different.
 The words and the pictures kind of fail to correlate entirely.
 The pictures tell one story, but the words tell a quite different one.
 The pictures are only there for illustration, decoration.
 They loosely, impressionistically illustrate important events in the written
 text, but only loosely.
 This comes as a mixture of disappointment and surprise, and an acknowledgement
 of defeat.
 My defense to my uncle was that I already knew what the story was, because
 I could tell, by looking at the pictures.
 I didn't have to read no god-damned words.
 I didn't swear, of course, I didn't know any swear words.
 But emotionally, it was like that.
 Fuck the words, I don't need no stinkin words.
 I can tell what's happening from the pictures, and goddamned pedants like
 you want me to fucking suffer and read fucking words for something that's
 already obvious from the pictures.
 This is what went through my mind.
 Fuck this shit.
 Words.
 Screw that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And yet, I sort of had to acknowledge that the story plot, as told by the
 pictures, was pretty friggin blurry and vague.
 I spent a *lot* of time decoding those pictures, trying to figure out what
 the story was, and failing.
 The panels in a Donald Duck comic book DO NOT TELL A STORY.
 Disney sucked, in that way.
 He could illustrate, but he could not make his illustrations talk.
 They were mute snapshots.
 He had to fucking fall back onto words to get thee point across, and those
 words really for the most part had almost nothing at all to do with any
 implied plot-line you could extract from the pictures.
 This is what I was thinking.
 This is how I thought.
 Well, I wasn't diretly critical of Disney, not yet, because I hadn't yet
 discovered this non-correlation.
 But I did read one or two or maybe three comic books that day, and I do
 have to say that Disney wrecked the magic.
 There was magic in the pictures, and the words fucking wrecked it.
 I mean, the words were fun, and I do have to say that the plot lines were
 far, far more complex and sophisticated than what the pictures told.
 So, if you could gain satisfaction from reading words, then I guess that's
 an OK thing, but it came at the cost of ruining the pleasure and enjoyment
 of looking at the pictures.
 So, yeah, Disney sucked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I mean, I read a few more comic books in the years to come, but it was never
 actually fun.
 It was a pass-time.
 It was an OK time way to spend some time, but it was not something I looked
 forward to, not something were I'd think, wow, now I get to do this, can't
 wait! Disney ruined comics.
 I wonder if this is an issue with Disney, and other artists dont have this
 problem, or what.
 But I think this stuff is invisible to adults.
 Some adult somewhere would have to take active, conscious effort to do
 better.
 Wel, look, maybe its loke one of those New Yorker

 contests.
 See, what Disney should have done was to draw the pictures first, and then
 given them to someone else, to come up with a story and plot.
 But I think he was an illustrator.
 He wrote the words, first, and then just illustrated.
 I have no clue if he was conscious of this.
 If he was aware of this, and did this intentionally.
 I'm thinking he didn't.
 He thought he was creating something fun, imagined that he was creating
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

magic kingdoms
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but I can personally attest that it was the opposite.
 He destroyed magic.
 There was magic in the pictures, and the text fucking destroyed the magic.
 And the swear word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

fucking destroyed
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 is really what it felt like, when I was 5 or 6 years old, at my uncles
 house (apartment, actually.

If you don't beleive me, just go to the Magic Kingdoms in Florida or California.
 There's damned little, no magic in them.
 They're mostly flat, boring, stupid and meaningless.
 I don't understand what the fuck people see in those places.
 They're just dumb.
 Fuck that.
 No adventure.
 Want to have adventure? Go to fucking Paris.
 Don't go to the fake-Paris cafe in Disneyland.
 But I digress.

Oh, one digression that might be worthwhile, because it explores the world
 of somatic feelings.
 So, as an adult, working for IBM, I'm sent to SIGGRAPH in Florida.
 I book a hotel in Disneyland.
 The Woodlands lodge, when it was brand new.
 Constructin copleted just weeks earlier.
 I have a late flight in, evening.
 Flying sucks.
 I actually planned to come a day early, to poke around, so evening flight
 so that I would not miss too much work.
 And its a long drive from the airport to Disney.
 Stand in a rental car line, all that hassle.
 And its hot, and its muggy, its Florida in the summertime.
 And I refuse to run the A/C in the car, on the matter of some kind of principle
, or something.
 So, I'm overdressed, hot muggy, wind-blown from driving wth the windows
 rolled down.
 Tried, vague headache.
 Lugging a heavy suitcase that hurts my hands and arms and back to lift,
 hurts my legs to walk and stand straight after sitting in a car for hours.
 Exhaustion.
 And I walk ito the lobby of the Woodlands Hotel.
 And its cold.
 Room checkin.
 I mean, cold.
 But refreshingly cold.
 And there's a scent of burning pine.
 And as I'm at the counter, waiting for my room key, I'm already being transport
ed to Northern Wisconsin.
 A chill in the air, a mild aroma of pine waffting through the air.
 And its very relaxing.
 After that drive in the Florida humidity, its the perfect antidote.
 And its subtle and its gentle and its refreshing, and it feels good.
 It hits the spot.
 Now this, this is Disney magic.
 This really worked.

Well, the wonderful doesn't come until I start looking around the lobby.
 OMG.
 Its a cavernous Candian, Seattle woodlands lodge.
 There is a two story-tall fireplace in the corner, with a roaring fire.
 To heat the place, because its frankly a bit chilly.
 And it is obviously the source of that buring pine smell.
 And the absurdity of it all is not lost on me: I know, I am aware that
 it is like 95 and humid outside, and its like 65 and dry and piney inside,
 so they've got the A/C cranked, and they are using an open fireplace to
 heat the place.
 Which is how it's done when you're in the Candian woods on a cool evening,
 and in Canadda (or Northern Wisconsin), *all* evenings are cool.
 And I'm looking around, and the whole place is decorated in cowboys and
 indians shibboleth.
 Boy-scout knives and axes.
 Drawing of teepees.
 And its luxury.
 So one thing that catches my eye is the floor is half marble, and half
 carpet, and these intermingle along curvey lines, streams.
 Not straight, but meandering.
 And I'm think 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

that's pretty classy, right there That.
 This is luxury
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I mean, the two-story fireplace in the corner, OK.
 But the attention to details, the floor of marble and carpet, that was
 something.
 And you know what? Those curvey lines lead to somewhere.
 There is a small stream in the floor.
 There is a small river-stream in the floor.
 It starts at the end of the lobby.
 You won't find it if you don't explore.
 It's not there to hit you over the head, its subtle and off to one side.
 But it is definitely water, and it definitely is flowing, and its a stream,
 a woodlands stream.
 Like in Wsconsin.
 But its late and its time to go to my room, and I've got these boyscout
 themes percolating all through, coloring my emotions and perceptions and
 visually smack in your face, because like someone took my Boy Scouts of
 America handbook, and literally copied pictures from it onto the walls
 of this hotel.
 and that is how I got to bed, go to sleep.
 Trannsported to a wonderland.
 So, yes, Disney is magic.
 Done right, its magic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I did go there, maybe a decade later.
 It was run down.
 Too many grimey kids scratching the paint off the walls, and puking onto
 the carpet and sticking thier grubby little hands into the woodlands stream.
 And I think the fireplace was turned off.
 But that was daytime, maybe they run the fireplace only at night.
 I dunno.
 Magic spells work only once.
 You can't go back there again.
 This is the tragedy of being caught here and now, with your memories.
 There is no time-travel.
 There is no rewind button.
 Careful, Linas, lest your memories turn back to physics.

Back on track: so my Aunt feeds me sci-fi.
 I remember the first short story I ever read.
 I don't remember what it was about, but I do remember reading it.
 Wisconson.
 Northern Woodlands.
 Nothing to fucking do there.
 Boring, gotta do something.
 The DOnald Duck comic books suck (there's piles of them, up there) and
 so I pick up an issue of Science Fiction and Fantasy Magazine.
 And I pick the absolute shortes thing that I can find that isn't letters
 to the editor.
 And its kind of disappointing, buecause its long.
 Like, over twenty pages.
 Oi vey.
 Long slog ahead.
 But whatever.
 I'm not gonna read another comic book, so dammit, if this is it, this is
 it.Its still early in the day, and its not like I have something better
 to do.
 So I read the short story.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And its not bad.
 And, you know, I could read more.
 (I think this is the next day.) and I think there is one more short story.
 But then there is this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

novella
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 And it is fucking seventy ages long.
 And I'm not going to read that, because it is just wayyyy too fucking long.
 And that sucks, and surely they could have put some short stories in tehr
 instead, instead of this fucking long novella.
 But, you know, out of desperation, I read it.
 It was not even science fiction, adding insult to injury.
 Thinking back, I think it was Stephen King.
 Something about a man and a high tower and a dusty bottle of whiskey.
 Stephen King has something with those elements.
 I even think they made it into a TV novella or something.

But I also spend a large chunk of my childhood reading electronics manuals.
 Why? I don't know.
 There were some at the library, and it's what I picked, and I could not
 tell you why I picked those instead of something else.
 So that's curious: I can tell you minutae about learning to read, but nothing
 at all about why I chose electronics later in life.
 So I get to the school career counseling session, and you are supposed
 to pick out three different career tracks: these are printed 8.5x11 cards,
 and they each describe a possible career, and you are supposed to pick
 out three of them, something you might want to do with your life, and discuss
 them with the career counselor at the front of the room.
 So I pick three: electronics design, and radio repair, and some distant
 third, like maybe running a TV station, something I did not want to do,
 but you have to pick three, so whatever.
 And the counseler gets mad: you were supposed to pick three *different*
 things, you moron, and you picked all three the same.
 So it is a very very short counselling session.
 He says

So I get to college, and it is time to pick a major, and I pick physics.
 Why? I can tell you exactly why.
 A total and complete lack of imagination.
 Sure, history amd art are options.
 I liked Lithuanian history, especially the knights: Karalius Mindaugas.
 And Algirdas and Kestutis.
 The union with the Poles, Liublino Unija, Jadwiga and all that, that kind
 of sucked.
 And I liked Art with a capital A.
 My uncle was a world-class fine artist, painting brilliant paintings.
 And its all lost.
 Well, not lost: those paintings are in my mom's house, and some are now
 in Kaunas, Ciurlionoio museum donation.
 And some canvases in Chicago, the watch-a-ma-call-it Lithuanian museum
 in, wherever that is.
 I don't have much deaings thre.
 His paintins sit, forgotten, in a dark basement.
 It sucks.
 And I don't know how to fix that.
 My uncle desreves wayyyyy more recognition than he's gotten.
 Alas.
 Someday, I'll get around to this.
 But I digress.
 Back to college.
 I mean, I'm like really good at art, and I took four fucking years of Art
 History in high school.
 I know this shit.
 But the college major is physics, because, well, because.
 I don't think I even consider anything else, outside of these three.
 All other academic fields of study are on the other side of my personal
 cosmological event horizon.
 Mathematics would have been a distant fourth place.
 Later on I learn how to make mean, snide remarks about PoliSci, but I never
 get a chance to actually say them out loud.
 So physics it is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first-year class is a wash-out class.
 Starts with 150 students in a large ampitheatre lecture hall in Ryerson.
 Its already 120 by two weeks in, noticably thinning, and maybe 70 by the
 fifth week.
 Half wash out in five weeks.
 I'm guessing the quarter ends with about 60.
 Year (two more quarters) end with maybe 50, and sophmore year starts with
 45, and I think its mostly stable.
 Maybe down to 40 or so, I dunno.
 I'm smoking lots of pot, and partying cause that's what you do in college.
 Its either that, or studying in the library from noon to closing time at
 10 PM.
 Fourth floor was my favorite.
 The cool kids say the 3rd floor was the best.
 What do I know.
 I'd try the 3rd floor, time to time.
 I liked the 4th better.

Junior year, I realize physics is boring.
 I'm desperate.
 I'm ready to slit my wrists.
 No I'm not: that's just hyperbole, a hyperbolic statement.
 It's just something you say, its not like I ever thought about wrists or
 bleeding or killing myself or anything even remotely related to anything
 at all like that.
 But its an excellent hyperbolic statement.
 I'm ready to slit my wrists, that's how boring physics is.
 So I want to change my major.
 To what? I see the counselor.
 Well, there's PERL.

 And I say, thank you but no thank you.
 I sign up for a course on anthropology.
 South Sea Islands, and Struturalism, and all that.
 Another on child development.
 Lots of Piaget.
 I sit in the math library, and study books on Turing machines and Church
 and Lambda calculus, my junior year.
 I'm drawn to it magnitically, its like the hippest, coolest and most awesome
 thing to be found in the library, and I ferverently wish for a universe
 where I could be transported, to study those things full time.
 But I never get very far, very deep, because, you know regular homework
 is, like, due, and there's only so much time for fucking around, no matter
 how beguiling the promise of AI in Turing machines might be.

\begin_layout Standard
And one of the junior-year classes is intro to quantum mechanics.
 And things get weird here.
 So, forst of all, its totally impenetrable.
 Ugo Fano, he must be 70 by now, hes's fucking old, and I'm like still a
 teenager, I think 19.
 Much much later I find out I'm the youngest kid in my class.
 At University of Chicago.
 So I guess that makes me smart.
 Anyway, Ugo Fano is old and the textbook is impenetrable.
 It is a hand-typed manuscript, with hand-drawings.
 Published by the University of Chicago Press.
 Much later, second or third quarter, one girl in the class (the only girl?
 I wish I could remember her name, but I can't.
 She was ranked #2 in the graduating class.
 I was ranked #3.
 Who was #1? Fuck if I know.
 #1 was some hime-schooled kid, like fourteen, who was like, you know too
 fucking young to even attended the classes the rest of us did.
 See, I'm smart.
 Youngest kid in the college, who is actually attending classes.
 Ranked #3 of all graduating physics majors.
 Number fucking three.
 Everything in my life, I'm number three.
 It's quite humbling.
 Even a kind of a curse.
 I could have been just plain stupid.
 Or I could have been number one and shrugged it off.
 But no, I'm number three.
 And still shrugging it off.
 But I digress.) So she comes back from the stacks, and she's got a book
 that explains what quantum spin is, cause you know its a total fucking
 mystery, what the fuck is spin? And there's this glossy, hard-cover textbook,
 classic crisp high-kaolin-content glossy paper textbook pages, elegant
 typesetting, good layout.
 Like a super-mainstream college textbook, the very model of what a textboook
 should be.
 And it explains spin.
 And there a diagram, and equantions, recognizable equations, that we understand
 and somehow shed insight and understanding.
 And we are both like, wtf, why can't we use this textbook for class? This
 textbook is clear.
 And who wrote it? Ugo Fano.
 Yes.
 The same guy who is teaching us now.
 He wrote it 20 or 30 years earlier, published in the 1950's.
 A mainstream college physics quantum mechanics textbook.
 And not the only one.
 I think he wrote another, too.
 And instead of that, we are studying from this type-written, hand-drawn
 manuscript printed on plain white paper.
 This impenetrable morass of meandering re-analysis of the must fundamental
 and the most basic experiments from the dawn of the atomic age, trying
 to articulate quantum phenomena in a semi-classical language appropriate
 for 1910 or 1920.
 Thinking the way people were thinking in 1910 or 1920, before they had
 figured it out.
 Fano didn't say so, and we didn't know so, but in retrospect, that is what
 it was.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what was that? I think, when he got old, he realized that he did not
 understand quantum either, and had noo clue what spin was.
 Here' the man who helped found quantum chemistry, and MO-LCAO (Molecular
 Orbital=Linear Combination of Atomic Orbiitals), a man who was actually
 famous for his contributions ot quantum mechanics.
 He didn't understand it.
 And so this typewritten manuscript was his last, best attempt to go back
 to the basics, and see if we missed something.
 Maybe there was a needle in the haystack.
 Somethng we missed, something important.
 If we only go back, and look at the evidence again.
 And that is what he was teaching.
 The raw evidence.
 The experiements.
 The minimlaist, confusing semi-classical explanations of the experimental
 results.
 COnfusing as shit for use youngsters.
 There is a reason that mainstream college textbooks win out.
 Even stupid kids can read mainstream college textbooks, and say

 Stupid people consign confusing things to the dustbin of history.
 The University of Chcago did not publish Ugo Fano's last and greatest attempt

So, yeah, quantum is weird.
 My senior year, I take the first-year grad-school course in quantum mechanics.

 It's great.
 Quantum is fugnuts wierd.
 I think I wrote about the prof in this diary before: he's the one who pulls
 me into his office, shuts the door, and makes me swear an oath to never-verr
 talk about quantum with ordinary laymen, people who do not have a formal
 education in physics.
 Like you know, he was swearing me into the Manhattan Poject, or something.

 And Paris on LSD and shrooms.
 That's what quantum was.

 The same utter and complete lack of imagination on my part that lead me

 p.s.
 Did I meantion I finished college in less than four years? Youngest kid,

 Youngest kid except for that home-schooled boy.

 FORTRAN to analyze Pioneer-10/11 spacecraft data.

 Margert Edsall.
 My understanding is shees Dean of Students at Columbia in New York City.

 She married her housemate Mike Parides.
 Who lived in the room next door, while we fucked.
 He would fall asleep with the TV on.
 Poor guy.
 He's an MD.

 Some Arab hired him once.
 Guys in dark suits, black mustaches and mirror sunglesses whicked him off

 I was there.
 They looked at me, and decided I was not a threat to Arabs.
 I assume Margaret married Mike because, well, Mike coud get a job iin New

 I'd be an academic loser, tossing and turning and unable to find my place

 Margaaret was on a track.
 She knew where she was going.
 She also had some talents for manipulation.

There's more to this story.
 I sank even lower.
 I'm recovering now, but its a bit late in life for that.
 I'm sixty-five, not twenty.
 I'm still smart.
 I've been doing AGI for 15-plus years now.
 Leveraging both physics and computer engineering, and of course, math,

\begin_inset Quotes eld

what is AGI?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Because it seems to be a self-evident question.
 But I want to ask that question in all seriousness now.
 To really explore it.
 What is AGI?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So here's the catch.
 It's 4PM.
 It is sunny outside, and I need some exercise.
 I am exhausted by the time/effort to write the above, I need to take a
 break.
 This is the same reason I'm not a bitcoin billionaire: it was sunny and
 warm outside, I needed to take a break.
 Installing that bitcoin miner would have been a cool thing to do, but I
 needed a break.
 So I'm going to do this to AGI, too.
 I told myself I'd get back to bitcoin mining, but I never did.
 I do plan to get back to AGI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's the deal.
 Talking and thinking about AGI won't be just a few pages or a few hours.
 As I told my son this morning: physics traps us in the prison of the here
 and now, the present.
 It gives us things like love, which I've known intimately, and things like
 evil, which I do not.
 Suffice it to say that some people really do seem to be evil (and not just
 stupid), and to be evil from a young age.
 Or something.
 This requires some intllectual effort.
 And now, with AGI, we (I? no, we.) We talk of building an artifical silicon
 intelligence that will occupy the same prison of here and now, and it is
 to be generally intellegent, which means, to me, to know love and evil.
 So the AGI topic will have to encompass that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And, of course, I will also ramble on about state vectors and high dimensions,
 and parallel Beysian priors (ahem, integrals) (Oh, I gotta copy those essays
 from the opencog wiki to here.) and I will talk about neural nets and LLMs.
 And of course high-dimensional vectors of jigsaws: sheafs, that is.
 Sheafs of networks.
 Sheaf-theoretic sheafs, and for what? The rason I have to step back and
 ask 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is because I'm getting lost in these details.
 Yes, blah blah agentic.
 Blah-blah sensori-motor.
 Blah blah world-model.
 Self and not self.
 And fucking free fucking will.
 This diary has already witnessed my flailing about with free will, and
 more than once.
 And so this is the question, the narrative: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What is AGI?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and if the answer doesn't give proper justice and dues to love and evil,
 if it doesn't give proper justice to free will and the prison of now, and
 if it doesn't give justice to everything we know about computer science
 and engineering and physics and math, and if that answer fails to incorporate
 the reality of Wetern Civilization and Political Economy (and captialist
 economy) and the affordances for humans to manpulated the world in which
 they live, affordances in the sense of handles on coffee cups taht allow
 me to pick up coffee cups easily without buring my hands, if the answer
 to the question of AGI does not someohow encompass fucking everything,
 then it is a failure.
 So that's the ground rules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh and one more rule, perhaps the most important of all: now what? What
 is there to be done, next? I mean, in the practical, immediate, consequential

Decide

 Now what, What do we do next? The Act part is easy: its a long slide downhill
 again.
 One foot in front of the other.
 But the Orient-Decide phase: this is the trap a trap like a fly on fly-paper.
 I have to be able to grasp ASI, which is, well, everything, and wrestle
 it into a position where I can decide to act, and to do so, unlike that
 unfortunate fly, of getting my belly stuck to the fly-paper.
 This is going to be a challenge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I thought I knew what I was going to write next, and I think perhaps I still

 But its nice outside, and I really must get to going.
 I've spilt too many words.
 Toodle-oo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, I am going to eat an apple first.
 So one or two more paragraphs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, lets get out of the way some basics: an AI has to be agentic.
 But a cruise missile is agentic, too.
 So this is where free will gets tangled in.
 I'm not sure I want to do that tangle, but it might be unavoidable.
 Classic AI is focused on rational inference, deduction.
 And I guess this is OK.
 When I learned to read Dr.
 Seuss, I was creating rational, inferential hypothesis about how my local
 sensiry environment worked.
 And I was conscious of making those hypothesis.
 I recorded them in memory as my manin intellectual activity.
 The actual 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

learning to read
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was a side-show, a pleasant distraction.
 The intellectual heavy-lifting was the decision to look for correlations
 between sight and sound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so we can weave this together to form the first lesson of AGI.
 We can create a system capable of reasoning and deduction, in the very
 classical AI sense, but the result might just be a cruise missile.
 Feeling-lesss, emotionless, formal deduction towards an end and then boom.
 We can build these kinds of formal reasoning systems, but this is not quite
 exactly what we want to identify with as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

being alive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Cruse missles don't fall in love, nor would formal reasoning systems.
 Now, I employed a formal reasoning ssystem, when I learned how to read.
 But I would like to say I am not a cruise-missle.
 Now, anture gave me a brain that allowed me to perform the activities of
 anayzing my environment, and thereby getting drawn into the activity of
 learning to read.
 But there was more: I was bored.
 I had nothing better to do.
 Well, maybe I did.
 Maybe I could have crawled around under the dining room table, which is
 a pretty marvelous architectural space, with all those columns of chair
 legs and table legs all about, a large open central atrium at the center
 of the table.
 A table cloth forming a curtain along the edges.
 Humans like to wander around in Medieval Catholic Cathedrals.
 They like to shop at malls with atriums.
 Even hotels are built like that.
 So crawling under the living room dining table is a thing, a real thing,
 and a valid pursuit as an alternative to deploying my intellectual abilities
 to descern sight and sound, to correllate the printed and spoken word in
 a Dr.
 Suess book.
 And cruise missles don't get bored, and cruise missles don't crawl under
 tables, and cruise missles do not employ their dedductive, theorem-proving,
 inference and correlation engines to learn to read.
 Because, I guess, cruise missles don't get bored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, yes, the classic AI concept of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 But its not everything.
 And being an agent in the world is important, but its not everything.
 Having a world model is important, but not everything.
 The fucking thermostat has a one-bit model of the world: on or off, and
 it has the agential motor control of a header, coupled to a thermometric
 sensor.
 Does a thermostate have free will? The conventional, mainstream answer
 would be no.
 Does a thermostat get bored? I think not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So where does free will and boredom come from? I don't know.
 But one more aside first.
 Liebniz had the idea of monads, in pursuing the question of intelligence:
 splitting up intelligence into smaller and smaller peices, and so we get
 panpsychism.
 The thing is, Liebniz did not know about phase transitions.
 I've already talked about percolation in this diary.
 Less than a certain fracture, oil does not flow.
 More than that, it does.
 And so with intelligence.
 There is a phase transition, below which there is no intelligence, and
 above which there is.
 We do not know where that phase transition is.
 And so perhaps that is one of the central questions of AGI: where is that
 phase transtiion? And where are cruise missles located with respect to
 that transition? Or, fuck all, ants.
 Or ameboa.
 Yikes!

\begin_layout Standard
Later in the day.
 Post shower.
 What am I doing here? Writing a diary, obviously.
 Not science.
 Nothing I write here conforms to any conventional standards of science.
 Nothing would pass peer review.
 Amateur philosophy? See, the problem is most famous philosophers were crackpots.
 Smart, brilliant, even, but making inferences far beyond the ken of science.
 Give them some credit I guess, for venturing into the unknown.
 Subtract points for making assured claims with nothing but hand-waving
 for support.
 So I don't want to do that.
 Feynmann might advise 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shut up and calculate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but I already calculate a lot, so coming up for air, and asking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

why calculate this and not that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 seems like a legit thing to do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem with saying 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

intelligence appears on one side of a phase transition
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is that we don't have a coherent definition of intelligence.
 Clearly animals have it.
 Is it limited to neural nets? One can make coherent arguments that it is
 not.
 But is the behavior of slime molds 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

intelligent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? One slides down a panpsychic slide, attributing intelligence, or fractions
 thereof, to simpler and simpler systems.
 There's no obvious phase transition in there, somewhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What about free will? A few weeks earlier, in this diary, I came to conclusion,
 arguably total nonsense and hallucination, that free will arises at a Cauchy
 horizon.
 Now this is meant to be taken not literally, but metaphorically, but also
 meta-literally, in that there might be differentiable, causal structures
 appearing in our brains that have singularaties, singular solutions.
 So, first lets regurgitate the conventional reasons why my idea here is
 fundamentally bad.
 First, one hand-waves, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quantum gravity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, implying that if we had a theory of quantum gravity, then the singularities
 (in black holes) go away, and everything is hunky-dory, and no more Cauchy
 horizon, tah-dah.
 But that's physics.
 In math, we still have the issue that we can write down systems of equations,
 that happen to have applicability to physics, but those systems of equations
 admit solutions that are wonky.
 Quantum gravity does not alter the math one whit.
 The formal mathematical pheonomena remains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What makes the Cauchy horizon intereting is that its not a set of measure
 zero.
 We've got a gazillion examples of singularities on the complex plane, but
 any geodesic-like curve one could draw, well most of them would have to
 bump into a set of measure zero.
 Now, there's some fascinating descent into the theory of the sizes of things,
 which promptly leads to the Axiom of Choice, and to Borel Hierarchies,
 and Cohen's forcing and all that.
 Wikedly interesting stuff.
 But the Cauchy horizon is not like that: living between the cracks.
 The Cauchy horizon is big and bold and measure-theoretically large.
 There's no Alexander's horns here, No knots sitting the three-spaces that
 bound 4-spheres.
 The horizon is big and bold and in your face.
 Its not going away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So my question is: are there any dynamical systems, aside from gravity,
 that exhibit Cauchy horizoons, and might any of those dynamical systems
 appear in settings where intelligence arises? Can I build some mechanical
 or fluid-dynamic system, some analog, in which there is a Cauchy horizon?
 I'm thinking yes, I can.
 Well, maybe not me, but in principle, and maybe it is doable, and maybe
 someone has done it.
 Gonna search-engine that later.
 Say its doable, then are there any biological systems that would have that?
 We could go all reductionist here, but that's absrd because it would imply
 that we'd need quantum gravity to explain biology, and that is a non-starter.
 But still, are there any systems in nature, outside of the setting of gravitati
on, that exhibit a Cauchy horizon? If so, then can I ascribe this some property
 of free will? Anyone who reads this and is smart enough to understand what
 I'm saying will say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fuck no, Linas, that's crazy, that's wrong.
 You're nuts.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 So whatever.
 fuck you, too.
 See, I'm looking for free will, because if I can find that, it provides
 a workable defintion of intelligence: things that have free will are intelligen
t, no matter how small and simple they are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, so here I anticipate another ovious objection.
 I can hear it now: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Linas you are talking about a random number generator, and mechanical systems
 hooked up to random number generators are not intelligent.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 And this is true.
 But the Cauchy horizon is not a random number generator.
 I want to argue more: it is an all-possibilities generator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So here.
 Conventionally, all-possibilities appear in the partition function:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z=\int\left[d\phi\right]\exp i\mbox{Action}
\]

\end_inset

Since the action contains derivatives, the discontinuous possibilites get
 a weighting of zero and don't contribute.
 Now, there are severe measure-theoretic difficulties plaguing the partition
 function, but that never stopped the physics community.
 Some what I'm now saying is, what if the action doesn't supress a sizable
 number of non-differentiable field configurations 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

? Yes, of course, I'm piling on a mathematically ill-defined idea on top
 of something that is already ill-defined when its behaving nicely.
 What if free will and choice are those things that glue together the disparate
 universes?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To be clear on terminology: a single choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

universe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; universes and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 are in one-to-one correspondence, and the integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\left[d\phi\right]$
\end_inset

 is an integral over all universes.
 The exp i Action just gives the weighting or liklihood of that universe
 contributing to the partition function.
 FWIW, Bayesian priors work exactly like this.
 Now, by convention, one is to imagine that all of these distinct 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 are entirely independent of one-another.
 Nothing one can do in one can influence another.
 Perhaps oe imagines the 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 as sheets of paper, stacked.
 Close, but nothing written on one page bleeds to another.
 That's the conventional view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now what if, instead, the Cauchy horizon (or it's metaphorical replacement)
 is where all these sheets come together? The hand-waving argument would
 be that its like a singularity, say, the location 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

 in the complex plane for 
\begin_inset Formula $\log z$
\end_inset

.
 If you sit on a curve and fly into 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0,$
\end_inset

 you don't die, you just come out on every or any other sheet.
 If there's going to be a conservation of curves, then you're allowed to
 come out on any sheet of your choosing, but only one.
 What is that? A random–number choice? A flip-coin choice? Some axiom-of-choice
 thing? I don't know.
 I don't think its a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

random number
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and I don't know what it means 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

to choose
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in this situation.
 But this is an example of where a singular point glues together many sheets.
 But, you say, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

those sheeets were never independent universes.
 You could always get from one to the other by circling around the pole,
 gaining a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi i$
\end_inset

 each time around
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 And, yeah, well covering spaces tend to be simply connected.
 Or perhaps that's the definition of a covering space: its that simply-connected
 thing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I dunno.
 Perhaps I've gone off the deep end.
 But it seems like free will needs this kind of lugubrious theorizing, because
 otherwise, we are trapped with the nitwits who insist we don't have free
 will and its all just random numbers, but those people are nitwits.
 And they say, never argue with a fool, because the onlookers won't be able
 to tell the difference.
 So I'm not gonna argue with those fools.
 Instead I'll do some vague mathemaical fantasizing.
 But really.
 I think part of what I sketch above has legs.
 I think something can be made of it.
 Tightened up, made concrete.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But this puts us in a chicken-and-egg scenario.
 If intelligent systems are exactly those that have free will, and I cannot
 give a workable defintion of free will, then I'm hosed again.
 There are others, who are not nitwits, who think panpsychism is the answer.
 And anyway, its not like the panpsychists can offer up any kind of theoretical
 mechanics that allows a workable definition of intellgence to be coded
 up in software.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I seem to hit a dead end here.
 One that I've hit before.
 Although this time, I think I made a tiny amount of progress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Are there other ways of thinking about AGI? Well, I suppose I could take
 a more mundane and pedestrian view.
 Lets take a moment to walk through those.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So one is the agentic system.
 A system that has a model of the world, a distinct inside and outside,
 a sensori-motor system.
 But we've already noted that thermostats and cruise missiles have this,
 and I don't want to give those any ascriptions of being alive or intelligent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then there's explosive replicators.
 DNA embodied in bacteria, etc.
 explosively replicate as long as there's food.
 And convnetionally, we say bacteria are alive.
 So I'm OK with saying explosive replicators are alive.
 But that's also not AGI.
 I can't build a computer model of a bacterium and pass it off as AGI, because...
 because why? Because it cannot be hooked up to google and work as an oracle
 for answering questions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So is an oracle for answering questions, is that AGI? Well clearly, good
 AGI would be an oracle (well, oracle-like in the informal sense, not the
 computer-science sense).
 But the converse ain't true.
 Oracles aren't AGI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I felt I was onto something, when I started talking about boredom, and love,
 and evil.
 Love is ...
 well, love can be explained away as some limbic, somatic, reptilian-brain
 response for procreation, but anyone who has been in love knows that this
 is an inadequate, mechanistic explanation offered up by nitwits who like
 to pretend that they're know-it-alls.
 I can't speak for the poets, but the movie 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The Fifth Element
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich does get the general nature of the
 thing correct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dafuq.
 I used the word lugubrious.
 I can use it again.
 Wander down the hallways of love, boredom and evil and kind of not get
 any closer to a workable definition of AGI than I didn't have before.
 Is it like Art? 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can't define it, but I know it when I see it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 But I'm not trying to reduce Art to an algorithm.
 I am trying to reduce AGI to an algorithm but it seems right up there with
 trying to reduce love, boredom and evil to an algorithm.
 I mean, if you can't define it, you can't create software that works at
 that level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the risks are equally obvious: like creating that 18th century robotic
 schoolboy, sitting at his desk writing schoolwork: a simulacrum can be
 created, but thats not the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real thing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The Polish sci-fi writer, Stanislaw Lem, has some story where reality is
 shown to be some LP recording, the mechanism of which is dicey and jamming.
 I can build a simulacrum of love, but that's not love.
 Again, we slip into philosophy.
 I had a book, while still a teen, Danial Dennet.
 It was OK.
 It did not light my fire.
 But it did illsutrate one story with a cute robotic mouse with winking
 glowing LED eyes, and cooing sounds, and the protagonist is asked to smash
 it with a hammer.
 Its just a freakin robot, but we have this mamalian gut reaction to little
 furballs.
 There's even a TV commercial, from Ikea, that features an old sad desk
 lamp abandoned in the rain by the garbage.
 And a full length feature film, Brave Little Toaster, the ending of which
 is heart-rending.
 So these are the mamallian, limbic, somatic shadows of existence that we
 are immersed in.
 And my definition of AGI says that it too must partake of this world.
 And of course, I can create some software that claims that it does, but
 this is like that Star Trek episode where Data is placed on trial, accused
 of not being an actual being, of being a machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where's the phase transition to being-ness? Are you getting bored by this?
 Because I am.
 Clearly mammals are beings, and we do down that path and end up at panpsychism
 again.

\begin_layout Standard
You want to know how crazy I am? I'll tell you how crazy I am.
 If the universe doesn't stop me, first.
 Every time I'm about to do something stupid, the dog barks, and I say to

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

this is the universe reminding me to stop doing this stupid thing
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 And I'm typing this on a laptop with a shitty keyboard and a shitty touch-pad,
 and I'm making vast amounts of typos due to the mechanical misbehavior
 of this system vs.
 my hands.
 and every time I'm about to type something really exceptionally good, it
 gets tangled up, and again I think: this is the universe trying to stop
 me from spilling it's secrets.
 That's how crazy I am.
 I get those micro-thoughts, and I give them credence and credibility just
 long enough to wonder if its true.
 Because you know it could be.
 Who the fuck knows.
 The universe really could be fucking with me like that, because who is
 to say it isn't.
 We already have the Mandela effect.
 I didn't invent it, but I do suffer from it.
 I remember Nelson Mandela diying in a South African prison back in the
 1980s so what the fuck is allthis about him still being alive and all that?
 WTF Really? Maybe universes do cross over, or maybe the combination of
 statistics, news reporting and neuroscience just makes me victim to a mass
 delusion.
 Who is to say?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, and then there's math.
 I might have touched on this a bit in this diary, but really I could do
 more.
 Math is a potent hallucinogen.
 I don't feel like explaining this right now, but for a quick tour, look
 at what people said about the Cantor set, and what he did.
 It's crazy-hallucinatory.
 Obviously.
 Then there's the various paradozes of mesureability.
 Say the Banach-Tarski paradox.
 Crazy shit.
 There's lots more.
 Anything to with infinity.
 I think I've mentioned before the insanity of weak convergence in Hilbert
 spaces.
 QM is insane mostly because of this one thing, but that means that the
 problem lies not with QM, but with weak convergence in Hibert spaces, which
 is the root cause of quantum weirdness.
 So its not the physics that's insane, its the math.
 And so if math, the most staid, assured, unassailable, confident rock-hard
 foundation-stone of all things knowable: I meman really, who is going to
 argue that 2+2 isn't 4? This is a fact 2+2=4 and nothing you can do can
 change that.
 Its the rock-hard foundation.
 And that foundation includes fucking goddamned fucking prime numbers.
 And Banach-Tarski.
 And weak convergence in Hilbert spaces.
 And axioms of large cardinals.
 And Borel hierarchies.
 So fuck me, fuck that, math is fucking insane.
 Our foundation-stone of reality, 2+2=4, is simply the logo stamped on a
 universe-sized tablet of LSD.
 And fuck me, what, you want me to algorithmicisze this, and build you an
 AGI? I homunculus based on the the mystical elements of the Kaballah? Really?
 You don't need to get mystical.
 The mystical is already here, right now.
 Pervasive and permating pan-mysticism.
 Sheesh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I must bring tonights OODA loop of exploring AGI to an end.
 The observe and orient stuff ended with disorientation, and identified
 the proximal cause of that disorientation.
 Its built into the fucking math.
 So, deeper than being built into the fucking universe, its built into the
 fucking math.
 Excuse the swear words, but I know obscenity when I see it, and math is
 obscene.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Decide and Act.
 Well, the mundane decision is to tough it out.
 Put on that heavy back-pack, tie your boots and go out into that storm.
 Hump it over the mountain.
 Metaphorically, this means go out and read more academic journal articles,
 and participate in the day-today quotidian intellectual activities of the
 social world around me.
 This is, I guess, an admission of defeat.
 Not that I was ever expecting to win.
 But laser-like focus on a narrow topic is an excellent way of making dramatic
 progress, and I am anything but laser-like here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another analogy.
 I could moan about number theory here, instead of AGI.
 Or I could just go out and do it.
 I think I did pretty well with the beta transform: hundreds of pages of
 laser-like, focused, insightful results.
 And no one cares because who the fuck cares about iterating 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta x\mod1$
\end_inset

? Almost no one.
 Maybe more than the number of people who care about this diary.
 Because the beta transform, the iterated 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta x\mod1$
\end_inset

 is considered to be unimportant.
 And see, that is my dilemna.
 I could spend the waning years of my life making sharp, insightful progress
 on narrow topics that are not important.
 Or I could moan about the inaccessability and ineffability of AGI.
 Or I could just fucking give up, and just do something that would bring
 me closer to nvidia gpus and weights and shut up and calculate, as feynmann
 would say.
 Or I could cast about.
 Because, see, all these other things are boring.
 I don't quite really want to do them, because they're not ...
 they're not worthy of my time.
 They're not a valid activity to while away the years.
 By contrast, moaning about the ineffability of AGI into this diary does
 seem like something worthwhile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let me be more direct.
 I think there's something here, and I think I could even make a bit of
 progress, if I could get my hands on it.
 But like the four-year-old stacking blocks, the blocks keep fumbling out
 of my hands.
 Something, something.
 Agential sensori-motor.
 Something something category theoretic.
 These blocks.
 I can almost assmeble them.
 And then the self doubts: I assembled some blocks.
 Is that a house that can be lived in? Is it a Roman colliseum? No.
 Is it AGI? err.
 Fuck.
 The blocks keep slipping away.
 But I think I've almost got my hands in it.
 If I just try a bit more.
 Something something Basal cognition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, reading more is really not a bad idea.
 It takes me back into the first O of OODA: more observation.
 Its a defferal of decide and act.
 Its more orientation.
 How much longer to decide and act? What's there to decide, if I can't figure
 out what the fucking problem is? I'll sleep on it.

\begin_layout Standard
I finished Tong's Lecture 2 on cosmology Lecture 3 awaits.

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, footnote.
 I'm loosely spell checking above, and Chinese Room pops into my mind.
 I always hated the Chinese room argument, I thought it was dumb.
 I see why some peopel feel like its worthwhile.
 But those people are just dumb.
 The Chinese room is like asking the sand grains in a sand-pile about how
 they know when to avalanche.
 You can look at any given grain of sand all you want, microscopic examination,
 and it won't get you to an adequate understanding of avalanches.
 So the same with the Chinese Room.
 Yes, you've got all these guys running around programmatically stacking
 algorithmic inferences and deductions, using the finest in proof theory
 and lambda calculus to do it, and then it all avalanches, and no one saw
 it coming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so maybe that's my definition of AGI.
 Its a proof-theoertic stack of inferences, so tall and so carefully balanced,
 hinged on countless delicate assumptions, that nudge some tiny little Bayesian
 prior, and half the stack comes sliding down in an avalanche.
 That avalanche is no longer algorithmic certainty, proof-theoretic provability
 carried out by minions in the Chinese room.
 One of the shmucks spilled a bottle of ink on the instructions, faked it
 and it all comes sliding down.
 This is what's wrong with the Chinese Room.
 The philosophers were so busy studying philosophy, that they didn't learn
 any physics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, my two-paragraph rebuttal of the Chinese Room is literary and
 allusory.
 What, exactly, in a stack of crsip proof deductions, comes tumbling down?
 Nervous breakdowns are breakdowns.
 Electrical dielectric failures are breakdowns.
 Tears, cracks, shattering.
 What, exactly, is supposed to be the analog of dielectric failure in symbolic
 reasoning? What's avalanching? Well, I earlier stated that 2+2=4 is rock
 solid, incontrovertible, unchallgengable, unalterable.
 I skipped mentioning 2+2 mod 3=1 In this tower of deduction, was there
 some quotienting there, where no one was paying attention? Something in
 a sigma-pi hierachy modulo some for-all, there exists, that has some alternativ
e interpretation, alternative valuation, different outr model than the intended
 model? That would avalanche.
 If something has multiple models, then what is true in one model might
 not be true in another.
 If the Chinese Room guys were working in one model, but really there was
 some other semantic interpretation, they were deriving things that were
 falsehoods when applied to the inner model.
 Some downward Skolem-Lowenstein lemma type thing.
 That would be the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

avalanche
\begin_inset Quotes erd

: you thought we were working 
\begin_inset Formula $\aleph_{0}$
\end_inset

 but I thoght we were working with 
\begin_inset Formula $\aleph_{1}$

 and so you're getting not just contradictions, but avalanches of incompatible
 inferences.
 That's the avalanche.
 That's how the Chinese room fails.

Modulo is weird.
 Learned that from

 The place where

 between countable and uncountable infinity.
 And this is merely the first level of the sigmapi hierarchy.
 There is an entire tower there, ready to fuck you and Banach-Tarski.
 Pleasantly fuck.
 While you're tripping on LSD.
 But fuck in surprising ways.
 The people who came up with the Chinese room never cracked open a book
 on model theory, and never learned how to get laid.

After yesterdays histrionics, lets see if we can do better today.
 We can take the pragmatic definition of AGI: it is that economically viable
 thinking machine that can replace high-priced engineers (and other high-priced
 humans) in the delivery of economically viable services.
 I've been talking to one fellow who wants to digest electronics diagrams
 and the surrounding English-language documentation to automate a repetitive
 process that engineers currently perform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is an eminently practical desire, the kind of which has been driving
 economics since about forever.
 It is also a task on the forefront of what is barely possible and acheivable
 with current technology.
 Insofar as I personally want to toil away on the creation of AGI, this
 is perhaps a task in which I should invest significant intellectual effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets for a moment imagine what this might be.
 Or not.
 Technology is in rapid flux, tools, features and functions are rapidly
 changing.
 What is commercially available right now can be adapted in this and such
 a way to the task.
 The tech stack selection I might make for a customer might be different
 from the tech stack I might wish to make for myself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets do some forecasting and prognostication.
 I have to be careful here.
 First and foremost, we have the sci-fi writers, who are quite good at looking
 at some present-day situation and extrapolating it to the future.
 We've got the TV show Black Mirror, which makes dark prognostications.
 Any number of youtube scifi shorts going in any number of directions.
 Amateur gatherings, like Less Wrong, exploring, like ants working a food
 source, exploring the implcations of this or that.
 Some are vastly smarter than others; Scott Alexander with Slate Star Codex
 rises far above.
 Some prognostications are economically valuable: Peter Zeihan seems to
 make a good living cooking up geopolitical ideas of all sorts.
 In short, there already is a rather extensive effort, work-front looking
 at present trends and extrapolating them into the future.
 It is hard to stay on top of it all.
 I've tried, and there are others who devote fulltime attention to this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why is it hard? For simple economic reasons: There are thousands, more,
 tens of thousands, and yet more, hundreds of thousands, if I count twitter
 posters, who are actively engaged in this.
 They are able to be actively engaged because, thanks to the miracle of
 modern capitalist economics, basic wants like food and shelter have been
 taken care of, and secondary desires, such as material accumulation and
 entertainment are equally fulfilled.
 This leaves one with lots of spare time to focus on tertiary issues.
 Tertiary here means very much the kind of stuff that, in the past, was

There's a different kind of prognostication, of the form done by David Chapman
 on Meaningness.
 In a different way, by John Vervaeke in his lecture series on the Meaning
 Crisis.
 This (these) are again very modern developments.
 Yes, sure, the burgoise of the 18th and 19th century could have nervous
 breakdowns because the meaning provided by society did not align with inate
 biological (somatic) drives.
 And then there are the Shakers, Quakers and any number of Protestant sects
 attempting to realign ways of existing with neurological drives, attempting
 to provide an all-encompsing answer, if not an eschatology.
 What's curious here is that the Quakers expose this as a modern-day example
 of the Meaning Crisis in an agrarian society.
 This is useful, because we don't have this for the Romans.
 Agrarian, politically very advanced, but the written record that the Romans
 left behind does not document psychological suffering.
 One does have to wonder why that is.
 Is it because the people who prepared Roman History for us, from Tacitus
 to modern times, have merely overlooked this? Is it because the society
 was too preoccupied with the act of living to get caught up in the doldrums
 of vague, unspecific dissatisfaction with life, building into an outright
 crisis? I don't know enough about Rome to say.
 Perhaps this is well-explored somewhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And this is another issue: everything is well-explored.
 Again, because of the economic richness of the current society has allowed
 vast numbers of intelligent, educated humans to explore all sorts of nooks
 and crannies of the noosphere.
 And the provisional definition of AGI is that it will do more of the same,
 at least, for the economically important tasks, which includes predicting
 the weather, designing rockets, and working out the must-have Christmas

I'm slipping into another groove that I visit and wrestle with: the entropy
 landscape from chemistry, bacterial quorum sensing, slime-mold decision
 making, the invention of neurons in jelly-fish as a mechanism for low-crosstalk
, high speed neurotransmitter star-gate transport, and then up through neuroanat
omy to humans.
 And of course it does not stop there: it continues on up into the economic
 world.
 And it feeds back: the nicotine industry supplies brains very directly
 with a desirable neurotransmitter.
 Chrinstmas toy baubles are a few steps removed from the direct hit of nicotine
 or heroin, but, in some ways, drive the same, or similar neuro-anatomical,
 neuro-biochemical circuits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I once read a SciAm article on the mechanism of nicotine addiction: it was
 a stack of 5 or six chemical and neurological feedback loops, working at
 different timescale, each one of them craving nicotine.
 One feedback loop involved reuptake channels in synapses.
 That functions on the one-minute timescale.
 Something else, I forget what, provided feedback at the 15-minute to half-hour
 timescale, and is responsible for chain-smoking.
 Other drives function at the week and multi-month timescales, making nicotnie
 addiction hard to break: even if you shut down the hour-by-hour craving,
 there is still that circuit, lingering in the back of your head, that remembers
 how pleasureable smoking is, and reminds you, month after month, that,
 well, it ws pleasurable.
 That's all.
 Have one now and you could relive that pleasure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Huh.
 Relive that pleasure.
 This is the rewind button that the physics of here and now does not have.
 We cannot time-travel back in time to change things, but we can recrate

 And again and again, because those prior conditions were pleasureable.

 The algorithms, like Data in Star Trek, or the Chinese Room, or, for chris

 Literature, but there is no reason to beleive that LLM's actually suffer
 from nicotine cravings.
 The biological mechanism cannot be traced.
 An LLM can tell me all it wants about craving cigarettes.
 It can tell me about how it remembers eating ice-cream in childhood.
 I know both are a lie.
 This is the point the Chinese-Room people were trying to make.
 And, at that level, they were perfectly correct.
 They were only wrong in elevanting it up to some sacred philosophical principle.

Nicotine and heroin are good for this kind of analysis, because we understand

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicotine and heroin are nice, because they also provide a scalpel with which
 to dissect Western Civ.
 The scalpel reveals that it is the drive to greater complexity that seems
 to matter.
 Heroin addiction is frowned upon because it is an economic and social waste.
 So, perhaps like leakage currents in an integrated circuit: it siphons
 off what is otherwise useable energy.
 The bio-feedback circuits build up to a stack of 4 or 6 cycles deep, and
 then no deeper.
 Maybe they layer on one or two moore feedback loops: the economic industry
 that produces heroin.
 The feedback here is financial.
 But, in many ways, it is destructive: economically, it seems like a net-loss.

 It killed young men at an industrial scale, and continued to do so until
 it literally ran out of raw material.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So this allows us to compare nicotine, heroin and WWI.
 So, micotine is a multi-billion-dollar economic organization, dating back
 to three or four centuries, supplying human brains with a desirable neurotransm
itter at an industrial scale.
 I already reviewed some of the nicotine addiction reinforcemet cycles,
 working at the minute, hour, day and month timeframes.
 These feedback loops were biochemical at the lowest level, neurological
 at the middle level, neuro-anatomic at the high level (memories of pleasurable
 minutes spent smoking pass through hippocampus and aygdala: this is anaotomy,
 sitting above the neuronal circuit level).
 Now we are ready to add one more feedback loop: cigarette advertising.
 This loop operates at the soco-economic level.
 Corporations buy billboard space, magazine pages and TV time from willing
 owners of TV stations, magazine and billboards, all to remind individuals
 how pleasurable smoking is.
 Thank goodness for ...
 well, that stuff in the 1970's that resulted in making cigarette advertising
 illegal.
 So it shut down another deleterious feedback cycle.
 This one operating at the super-human level.

\begin_layout Standard
And that is how one reduces cultural drives to entropic forces.
 This is kind of the big-bang theory of economics.
 We take bacterial quorum sensing, which involves small polypeptide signalling
 molecules, of which nictine is but one example, and ratchet this up through
 neurons, and then brains, and then society.
 From Atoms to Geopolitical forces, in one reductionist tour-de-force.
 Nicotine is nice, because it shows the clear path.
 Heroin is nice, because it shows the same path, but is far more obviously
 recognizable as deleterious.
 It shares much or most of the chimical, macro-molecular, neural and neuro-anato

.
 Someone had to grow cabbages in the field, to feed the soldiers, and someone
 had to run the factories that fixed nitrogen into explosive.
 This was an economic, industrial activity, and in this way resembles the
 economic and industrial activity of nicotine, substituting cabbage heads
 for tobacco leaves.
 The biochemical route is dettached.
 The call to patriotism dettaches somewhere at the socio-cultural layer,
 where upbringing and education are dominant forces, and perhaps at the
 genetic level, insofar as many individuals are predisposed to act in a
 certain way, in the same sense that certain dog breds or horse breeds behave
 the way they behave.
 Patriotism is not a signalling molecule like nicotine.
 But it is a stable and solid-enough foundation on which to build the apparatus
 of WWI.
 Or, for that matter, the current russian war on Ukraine.

 There's a symbolic layer hard at work, and symbology is pervasive.
 We have some tools for it: as mentioned, the lambda calc, the combinators,
 the category theory.
 The LLM's less so, they come in from the side, and need further theoretical
 analysis.
 But the name of the game is to boil down everything to structural analysis:
 from economics to genetics.
 Fringier is education, culture, advertising, propaganda, upbringing, political
 power.
 But these are just fringier.
 Softer than electrical circuits, because we are not used to drawing diagrams
 for these things.
 That's changing: we can now draw diagrams for the movement of populations
 across continents through the millenia.
 We can talk about how the populations carried both their genes and their
 langauge, and we can sketch circuit diagrams for this.
 Not very accurate ones: we need more archeology, more genetics, more history
 to get more details, but the base connections are there.
 Some details might remain fuzzy forever.

And so that is the practical definition of AGI: the economically useful

 Represent all of this symbolically, and provide the tools to access and
 manipulate these representational structures using either langugage – text
 chat – or possibly GUI's with click-and-point.
 So, geographical maps, for example, if interested in geographical economic
 activity, history wars, or migration patterns of pre-historic humans.
 AGI is the common tool that can encapuslate and expose all of this.

 But we are getting there.
 You can train an NN on the Mandelbrot set, and it will draw a a good-enough
 approximation thereof.
 You can train an NN on a collection of propositions from first-order logic,
 and i will be able to generate the generative results: extracts from the
 language generated by the axioms and propositions f first order logic.
 And the ditto for second order: the relation between language and generation
 and axioms is will-understood by the proof-theorists and the model theorists.
 And someone out there is already aiming NN's at this material.

And where does this lead us? Well, again the examined and unexamined flows

 We are sufficiently removed from the Soviet system that it makes for a
 good model.
 Its more recent than WWI.
 It is less ambiguous that WWI; both sides of WWI didn't quite know what
 they were doing.
 The Soviets did.
 They figured out what they were doing, and then they honed it and developed
 it into a powerful totalizing system.
 Hitler started this, and he did understand the role of propaganda, but
 he shot his wad too soon.
 I can't make a cogent case that he should have paused after the Anschluss,
 this is for someone lese to make.
 But the post-war Soviet Empire had the time and the space to refine and
 hone its methods.
 It could deport entire nations to Siberia, and do it effectively, without
 interference.
 The irony here is that even as the KGB reached new heights of sophistication
 and techique in the control of propaganda, brain-washing and political
 messaging, at the very same time, the nomenklatura became increasingingly
 incompetent.
 They did not know how to promote capable people.
 In the end, we had Gorbachev, the most incompetent of the incompetent,
 governing an entire nation, and then the wheels came off.
 The only good news is that Trump appears to be more or less just as incompetent
 as Gorbachev.
 The wheels won't come off; the American machine is orders of magnitude
 stronger than the Soviet appartus ever was.
 But we do have the socio-economic problem of placing incompetents in postioins
 of great power.

So that's the aside: in capitalism, we have hierarchical structures of executive

 is going to have a hard time of it all, no matter how good they are at

 Incompetent CEO's, and unlucky CEO's find themselves at the head of bankrupt
 companies, and, if the company is smaller, it is allowed to fail and dissolve.
 The bigger ones are too big to fail.
 Which is unappetizing,but no one has a better idea.
 At the national level, we have forces that elevate total nincompoops like
