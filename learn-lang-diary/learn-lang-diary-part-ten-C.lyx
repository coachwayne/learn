\begin_layout Title
Diary - Part Ten-C
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
January 2025 – present
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepštas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Unlike parts one through nine in this series, this one is not really about
 the language-learning effort.
 It is instead a private diary; a continuation of Part Ten-B, which got
 over-long.
 It is not curated for human consumption; I am making the assumption that
 no human being will ever actually read this.
 Thus, its filled with random stuff I feel like writing.
 Some of it is very personal, some of it is nonsense.
 Mostly, I am finding that the act of writing helps otherwise vague and
 scattered thoughts quantum-collapse into a more coherent form, where I
 can examine them, like a dead butterfly pinned down in a display case.
 Dead words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Human readers are discouraged from reading this, on the grounds that there
 are probably better uses of your time, than to sync your thought-patterns
 onto mine own.
 Live your life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part Ten already got an introduction.
 How many more do you want?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
29 December 2024
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's a good time to start afresh.
 In short – dafuq am I doing? I seem to be going at max RPM in first gear.
 Is this supposed to be fun? I'm burning out writing the Atomese sensori-motor
 code.
 In the previous diary entry, I convinced myself that this was not a totally
 stupid idea.
 Now, I am not so sure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the early visions for Atomese was to create affordances suitable
 for algorithmic boostrapping.
 This is a nice vision, but perhaps a mistake – and on multiple levels,
 a mistake.
 Perhaps I got lost in the details.
 The details are a vision of computing from 100 years ago: that lambda calculus
 can say anything sayable.
 Updated to more modern time, we find that lambda calculs is the internal
 language of Cartesian Closed Categories.
 These are big words, and the bigness of them is beguiling, and I think
 lie at the heart of the mistake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thanks to my physics/math background, it was very natural for me to dive
 deeply into the microscopic details of structural atoms.
 Perhaps one of my finest acheivements is coming to an understanding that
 jigsaw pieces are perhaps an ideal structural element.
 Jigsaw can be used to build anything.
 They are more naturally expressive than lambdas, and have natural identificatio
n with tensors (and the many-world parallelisms of tensors).
 Making them ideal for Bayesian priors, and other many-choice settings.
 They have natural interpretation as graphs.
 But they're typed, and so carry significant information (having significant
 information content.) And I didn't invent them.
 Many other have invented and reinvented them, over the decades.
 So, all around goodness.
 So why am I crying? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, if the goal is to build AGI ...
 well, if jigsaws are like atoms (like literally, cehmical atoms) I'm daydreamin
g of creating biology from them.
 Well, that's nuts: biomolecules have millios of atoms (daltons, or whatever).
 I'm not gonna get there.
 I might discover some cute low-level assemblies.
 But that's it.
 Not scalable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, second example.
 It's like day-dreaming of building a computer from individual transistors.
 Of course, this has been done, but it took decades and tens of thousands
 of engineers.
 There's pretty much exactly zero infrastructure for working with jigsaws.
 Like just about none at all.
 So I'm at square one.
 No one is interested, no one is helping.
 Basically, it won't happen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, third example.
 It's like day-dreaming of building a neural net out of individual neurons.
 Oh wait ...
 well, again, this has happened.
 Again, this took decades and tens of thousands of academics, grad students,
 engineers, tinkerers of all kinds.
 So, yes, neural nets all start with a single sum and a single sigmoid,
 but the scaling is the result of a massive engineering effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I think jigsaws are as promising as any of these things, as a basic, basal,
 low-level self-assembling structural component.
 Its just that ...
 I'm at square one, and no one shares my vision.
 So its not going anywhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What to do? Well, the lesson to be taken from LLM's or, perhaps, Microsoft
 Copilot, is that the world is filled with human affordances.
 At this stage, in the early 21st century, it is easier to build neural
 nets that can work with the available human affordances, such as coding
 in java or python or whatever, than it is to create this assembly-like
 intermediate language I call 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Atomese
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Atomese was meant to make it esy for machines.
 But it starts at such a low level, that leveraging up seems single-handedly
 impossible.
 Just teach the computer to code in python, and be done with it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hah.
 And there's the rub.
 Current state of the art in neural nets suggests that they'll never be
 able to arrive at the abstractions needed for doing the kind of reification
 that humans natrually do.
 So licking back and waiting for AI to magically learn how to program seems
 ...
 well, it renders me into an observer, rather than participant.
 I'd rather participate, for now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So what can I grasp at, what can I do, to be effective? Well, I've got several
 more visions.
 I articulated them on the opencog wiki in the last few days, and also in
 a readme file somewhere.
 But again – they're visions, and from what I can tell, visions shared by
 no one, so I'm like – roll up your sleeves, and get to work, you dog.
 This leads to a feeling of hopelessness.
 I burn out from going max RPM in first gear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What should I do instead? When I ask this question explicitly, I rapidly
 get to the general perception of well, I can rattle off all the social,
 psychological, cultural, political, economic activities that humans engage
 in, and they are so varied.
 Somehow, being a medical doctor is worthier than sitting around doing cross-wor
ds all day.
 or being a junkie.
 Western culture got that part right.
 But perhaps medical doctors burn out: there's always one more patient to
 treat.
 So, me here: there's always one more technical paper to read, one more
 line of code to write.
 Max RPM in first gear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current Western-civ definition of shifting into higher gear is to garner
 money, power, fame, influence.
 Gaining any of those takes effort and talent, and like any human activities,
 take decades to hone one's skills.
 And as that is done, I read less papers.
 Perhaps this should be like atheltics: don't overtrain one muscle group,
 while leaving others atrophied? I've let my power, fame, money and influence
 atrophy.
 And now here I am, wimpering like the old man that I am, that my ethereal
 being hurts.
 The physical therapist suggests some simple exercises for the weak and
 dibilitated: pay the bills, read the email.
 Like any ordinary person recuperating frome an injury, taking the doctors
 advice is hard.
 I don't want to go out and exercise, to go out and exercise and gain the
 strength so I can go to the olympics of wealth, fame and power.
 Unh, unh.
 Cause people do what they want to do, and I am a person.
 Perhaps whats-hisname from Star Wars could say

force yourself
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but well, dafuq.
 I can force myself to ride a bike up that hill in Southern Walnut Creek
 bike trail.
 I can force myself to do what it takes to win gold medals at the US masters
 nationals.
 I do NOT have to force myself to read textbooks on general relativity or
 string theory, because I find that actuall fun.
 I do have to force myself to pay the blls and read the emails, cause that's
 not fun.
 Or something.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I feel like I am procrastinating.
 And, well, I am.
 Because the duties that I shirk do not provide the dopamine reward that
 I've grown accustomed to.
 I'm a goddamn dope addict, addicted to reading math textbooks, instead
 of doing whatever the fuck I should be doing.
 Crap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Worse: I engage in activities without asessing the worthiness of those activites.
 Like I spent a month hacking on the 25th anniversary edition of Bigfoot.
 (the i370 code base.) Its useless, cause no one but no one except maybe
 Paul Edwards, and even then that;s a maybe ...
 no one will ever use it and no one will ever care.
 I might as well have spent the month doing crossword puzzles, or mainlining
 heroin, or something.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was one minor utility: in the back of my mind, I got to review the
 landscape of operating system technology, from assemblers and compilers
 to kernels, and file systems and containers.
 It lead to my playing with Ceph, so now I've got my home cloud.
 And its interesting to see how Ceph is multi-machine autonomous in a way
 that single-machine OS'es are not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which brings me back to where I started: my current path of tinkering with
 Atomese is not going to recreate Ceph in my lifetime.
 So I'm torn.
 One part of me rests completely assured that million-dimensional vectors
 of jigsaws are absolutely the correct approach.
 Another part of me is repelled by the daunting task of taking the next
 steps.
 Or mis-steps, as they may be.
 A third part of me laments my wasted youth.
 A fourth part of me is more than happy to also waste my waning years.
 A fifth part of me is deluded into thinking that perhaps by verbalizing
 into this diary, something will happen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But is 10PM Sunday night, and I'm tired.
 I think I will go do something relaxing.
 I think I will got read more of David Tong's Cosmology.
 It's a nice treatment.
 I'd never really seen a decent treatment of FLRW before.
 It's not super-complex; the lectures are aimed at undergrads.
 But they're focused, concise, clear, well-written.
 Unlike a lot of crap I read.
 Why can't people write? I wonder if I can write.
 I think I can, but no one reads what i write, so maybe my topics, my style,
 the things I have to say just aren't, well, they're just not Kardashian
 enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With that, good night, adieu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
30 Dec 2024
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Big Think.
 Somehow, for decades, longer, since college, before, I've avoided actually
 thinking about the 
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

big question
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: what is AGI, really? I'm going to avoid it a bit more, with a few paragraphs
 of autobiography.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I remember the first time I built something.
 I stacked two blocks, one on top of another, and they didn't fall down.
 I got to three even, but could not move past that.
 Mother had gone shopping, I guess, and left my sister and I in the basement.
 The basement was kind of a safe space: nothing there, no way to escape,
 nothing to break, no way to get hurt, warm.
 I must have been four.
 My sister is a year and a half younger, I think she was sitting, crawling.
 I tried to show her how amazing it is to stack blocks, but she seemed disintere
sted.
 I think I even got her to stack two.
 No more.
 Actually, I think I got maybe five high.
 There were arch components, and a big trangular block, for a roman look.
 I might have stacked two columns, and put that on top.
 See, I don't clearly remember that any more, I remember the thrill of getting
 to three, and once that was mastered, the rest was down-hill.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I remember what the basement looked like.
 Grey enamel floor.
 Stairs in the center, no railings.
 Work-bench to one side, open space to the other, and then the furnace room.
 I could draw a plan, right now; I remember it photographically.
 Well, I did spend a lot of time down there.
 79th and Justine, Chicago, Illinois.
 I remember a lot of that interior.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I remember the day I learned to read.
 Fox in Sox.
 Doctor Suess.
 Mom had a record of that, vinyl LP.
 She put it on.
 Somewhere in the middle, I realized that the words I was hearing corellated
 with the symbols aka words on the page.
 Put it on again, from the beginning.
 Sure enough! The first 3,6,9,12 words correlate perfectly! The first two
 or three pages are similar, having similar arrangements of words, but subtley
 different, and from those subtle differences, I could tell that the spoken
 words started on page one, and not on page two or three.
 That they were in order, and not backwards order, or jumbled.
 The were perfectly synced, and started at the begining.
 I got so busy verifying the correlations on the first three pages, that
 I lost track on page four.
 No matter.
 Start it again.
 Yes, they correlation between sound and words persists through page five.
 I form a hypothesis: I bet it works that way, to the end of the book (which
 seems impossibly long, but there we go...) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I remember explicitly formulating this hypothesis.
 Of making this prediction.
 Prediction is the wrong word.
 Nor was it an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a ha
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 moment.
 I mean it was, but more like, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gee, I bet this goes on to the end
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Not betting with money, but more concretely: if I were to listen to the
 sounds again, they would match the words.
 The ability to listen to sounds again was unquestionable, a subconscious
 given, not available for analysis.
 Ditto the looking at the pages of the book.
 These were not topics of awareness.
 What was in the awareness was that if the actions were repeated, the correlatio
ns would persist.
 Perhaps inference is the right word.
 Prediction is the act of seeing something (visually) and knowing what will
 happen next (in time).
 But this correlation was not in time or space, it was abstract.
 Thus, I was not predicting anything.
 Rather, I made the inference that the sounds and the words are corellated.
 On the third or fourth listen I got maybe ten pages in, to the part

Knox in sox on fox in box.

 ...

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I got tangled up in there.
 I think my Mom didn't want to listen to it one more time, so that was it
 for the day.
 I got to finish the book, and eventually memorize it, over the next week.
 But that was it, that is how I learned to read.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A very conscious process, with explicit conscious formulation of hypothesis.
 Starting with a dawning awareness of correlations, the game was on: a sleuthing
, a analyszing a detective mystery: if we go back, and play the record again,
 then the words wer correlate, and they will do so exactly, and not just
 in some impressionistic form, but precisely.
 All this was in my conscious awareness: that it could have been merely
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

close and suggestive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and my hypothesis was that, no, it would not be just 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

suggestive of
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but that it would be exact.
 I was very concerned with lacunae.
 What if the spoken word skipped over pages? I paid attention to flipping
 the age: that the sounds, the spoken words, would correlate with what was
 non the next page, not skipping a word or two, not sliding in some syllables
 that preserved the beat and rhyme, but failed to actually correlate with
 what was printed on the page.
 All this was in my explicit consciouss awareness.
 You, dear reader, mught think I am confabuating, but I am not.
 This is what my memory functions recorded of the incident.
 They recorded the process of awning awareness, the inference, the hypothesis
 formulation, the explicit formulation of multiple competing hyopthesis
 (that the correlation was poor, inexact, skipped over words...) the surmise,
 surmission, that the correlation would be exact.
 The hope that it would be exact.
 Lurking in the back was even a sense of disappointment: if the spoken words
 failed to correlate with the text, I would be disappointed.
 A grand insight would be dashed.
 Reality would be random and vague and blurry.
 I wanted it to be sharp.
 I hoped it would be sharp.
 This is the emotional side.
 My memories do a poor job of recording emotions, but in this case, I know
 for sure that it would have been a disappointment, if the words didn't
 correlate, and that this sleuthing adventure would be quickly abandoned,
 and forgotten, if this was not the case.
 I had better things to do with my time, than to listen to some artistic
 impressionistic verbal recital that vaguely dealt with the same topics
 as the written book.
 I mean, that was fun and OK-ish, but definitely weak sauce.
 I could do something else.
 Like maybe wander into the living room, or something.
 There were lots of other interesting things to do.
 Crawl under the table, or something.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, I remember the floor plan.
 Visually.
 The radio, Blaupunkt.
 The record-player, in a cabinet above, a cabinet my father had made as
 a college design project.
 We still have it.
 It's up in the attic now.
 The aluminum legs are not quite strong enough to bear the weight.
 Its modern.
 It looks like a Mondrain painting, but furniture.
 Three open bays, a fourth bay with a black formica door.
 But I wander off-topic.
 Of course, everyone remembers many things, for may different reasons, in
 many different ways, in all sorts of different abstraction settings, with
 different kinds of focus on what was important, and what wasn't.
 Some people are ruled emotionally much more; others are analytic.
 I suppose I have to class myself on the analytic side.
 But I'm also normal.
 I'm good with the visual arts.
 I like music, I could play guitar.
 I like sports.
 Socializing with other people is my weak spot; I don't do much of this.
 i think my parents are partly responsible.
 They knew I was smart, and they very much did not want me to hang out with
 other kids, or, at least, other kids who were not Lithuanian.
 SO I got Audrius as a good freind.
 Audrius was not a genius.
 But I digress; this is not meant to be about my childhood, but about AGI.
 So, lets get back on track.
 and that means more autobiography, before I tackle AGI head-on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My aunt taught me how to read.
 Aunt Irena.
 When my parents vistied, she gave me and my sister some Donald Duck comic
 books to look over.
 She had quite the collection.
 (She also had first editions of Ancient Greek poetry, Sophocles, or something
 like that.
 She loved to read.
 I have a photo of here, knee-deep in Lake Michigan, with two other freinds,
 holding a book up.
 In water, Wth freinds.
 Books don't go into lakes, with water and freinds.
 But this is my Aunt Irena.
 So...) Anyway, so my uncle walks in, and catches us red-handed: we are merely
 looking at the pictures, and not actually reading the text.
 And it is clarified that at least I know how to read.
 My sister, maybe not quite yet.
 Unclear.
 But me, I can read, and my uncle is demanding in that way: you will submit
 a book report.
 You will read this, and next time I see you, you will submit a book report.
 This is the kind of threatening demands he would make.
 Take fun things and turn them into not-fun.
 My aunt intervenes, I think.
 She's much more gentle.
 She says, dont grill them.
 Never mind him.
 It's OK.
 But you really should read the words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And they're right.
 When you read the words to a Donald Duck comic book, the story really has
 nothing at all to do with what you imagined it was about.
 It's completely and totally different.
 The words and the pictures kind of fail to correlate entirely.
 The pictures tell one story, but the words tell a quite different one.
 The pictures are only there for illustration, decoration.
 They loosely, impressionistically illustrate important events in the written
 text, but only loosely.
 This comes as a mixture of disappointment and surprise, and an acknowledgement
 of defeat.
 My defense to my uncle was that I already knew what the story was, because
 I could tell, by looking at the pictures.
 I didn't have to read no god-damned words.
 I didn't swear, of course, I didn't know any swear words.
 But emotionally, it was like that.
 Fuck the words, I don't need no stinkin words.
 I can tell what's happening from the pictures, and goddamned pedants like
 you want me to fucking suffer and read fucking words for something that's
 already obvious from the pictures.
 This is what went through my mind.
 Fuck this shit.
 Words.
 Screw that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And yet, I sort of had to acknowledge that the story plot, as told by the
 pictures, was pretty friggin blurry and vague.
 I spent a *lot* of time decoding those pictures, trying to figure out what
 the story was, and failing.
 The panels in a Donald Duck comic book DO NOT TELL A STORY.
 Disney sucked, in that way.
 He could illustrate, but he could not make his illustrations talk.
 They were mute snapshots.
 He had to fucking fall back onto words to get thee point across, and those
 words really for the most part had almost nothing at all to do with any
 implied plot-line you could extract from the pictures.
 This is what I was thinking.
 This is how I thought.
 Well, I wasn't diretly critical of Disney, not yet, because I hadn't yet
 discovered this non-correlation.
 But I did read one or two or maybe three comic books that day, and I do
 have to say that Disney wrecked the magic.
 There was magic in the pictures, and the words fucking wrecked it.
 I mean, the words were fun, and I do have to say that the plot lines were
 far, far more complex and sophisticated than what the pictures told.
 So, if you could gain satisfaction from reading words, then I guess that's
 an OK thing, but it came at the cost of ruining the pleasure and enjoyment
 of looking at the pictures.
 So, yeah, Disney sucked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I mean, I read a few more comic books in the years to come, but it was never
 actually fun.
 It was a pass-time.
 It was an OK time way to spend some time, but it was not something I looked
 forward to, not something were I'd think, wow, now I get to do this, can't
 wait! Disney ruined comics.
 I wonder if this is an issue with Disney, and other artists dont have this
 problem, or what.
 But I think this stuff is invisible to adults.
 Some adult somewhere would have to take active, conscious effort to do
 better.
 Wel, look, maybe its loke one of those New Yorker

 contests.
 See, what Disney should have done was to draw the pictures first, and then
 given them to someone else, to come up with a story and plot.
 But I think he was an illustrator.
 He wrote the words, first, and then just illustrated.
 I have no clue if he was conscious of this.
 If he was aware of this, and did this intentionally.
 I'm thinking he didn't.
 He thought he was creating something fun, imagined that he was creating
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

magic kingdoms
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but I can personally attest that it was the opposite.
 He destroyed magic.
 There was magic in the pictures, and the text fucking destroyed the magic.
 And the swear word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

fucking destroyed
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 is really what it felt like, when I was 5 or 6 years old, at my uncles
 house (apartment, actually.
 58th and Dorchester, Hyde Park).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you don't beleive me, just go to the Magic Kingdoms in Florida or California.
 There's damned little, no magic in them.
 They're mostly flat, boring, stupid and meaningless.
 I don't understand what the fuck people see in those places.
 They're just dumb.
 Fuck that.
 No adventure.
 Want to have adventure? Go to fucking Paris.
 Don't go to the fake-Paris cafe in Disneyland.
