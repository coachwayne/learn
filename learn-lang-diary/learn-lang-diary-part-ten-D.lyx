\begin_layout Title
Diary - Part Ten-D
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
March 2025 – present
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepštas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Unlike parts one through nine in this series, this one is not really about
 the language–learning effort.
 It is instead a private diary; a continuation of Part Ten–C, which got
 over–long.
 It is not curated for human consumption; I am making the assumption that
 no human being will ever actually read this.
 Thus, it is filled with random stuff I feel like writing.
 Some of it is very personal, some of it is nonsense.
 Mostly, I am finding that the act of writing helps otherwise vague and
 scattered thoughts quantum–collapse into a more coherent form, where I
 can examine them, like a dead butterfly pinned down in a display case.
 Dead words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
If you are interested in this content, then you should ask an AI agent to
 read it, then pretended that it's me, then ask about it.
 I believe that present–day LLM technology is sufficiently advanced to be
 able to do this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part Ten already got an introduction.
 A different way of thinking is about what is going on here is that this
 is a form of life–logging.
 Or, in 18th century terms, a diary.
 Just not anywhere near as compelling as those written by the famous diarists.
 This one is more of a mental self–portrait.
 And not even for you but for myself.
 Not to cast a narcissistic gaze at my own words, but to organize my own
 thoughts.
 Still in the experimental stage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
9 March 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sooo ...
 Just woke up.
 Went to the RedThreadX talks at SXSW for the last two days.
 Invited speaker on the second day; first day was to explore the space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As always, I am struggling a bit to figure out if I should even bother to
 write any of this down.
 I have noticed that I do a fair bit of thought–processing as I sleep, although
 the collection of thoughts I examine then seem awfully random; explorations
 of different events in earlier parts of my life, and not at all focused.
 The diary here may be rambling and incoherent, my dreams are much more
 so.
 So perhaps writing this diary is an extension of the sleep state: an exploratio
n of thoughts, but this time focused much more strongly by conscious will.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If I keep walking down this path, I may discover that there is little difference
 between dream–states and waking states.
 I also suspect that this is one way of expressing what schizophrenia is.
 Now, I do not personally think that I am verging towards schizophrenia.
 However, I am wondering if Western Culture is becoming schizophrenic...
 or maybe the opposite? That the Western World, Humanity, is waking from
 a dream?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See? Perhaps it was worth the effort to write the above two paragraphs.
 So the experiment being run in this diary is nominally successful.
 On the other hand, there is a nagging voice that says this is all a waste
 of time, and that I really should be reading that paper on diffusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which brings me to another perennial topic: what should I be doing next?
 I started this, intending to write up impressions from RedThreadX, but
 that's already in the past, and I am being distracted by my current train
 of thought, which seems so much more important.
 Oh, wait.
 I wrote the above two sentences, and lost my train of thought.
 Shit.
 Conscious, directed thought remains a challenge.
 Of course, it is a well–known textbook psychology saw that creative states
 are exactly those that are unfocused, and I suppose that those same textbooks
 say something about dream–like states while one is awake.
 I wouldn't know, I've never read any of those textbooks.
 So why am I so confident that this material is in there? Because I guess
 I've been exposed to sufficient blurbs and itty–bitty sketches to know
 that this is what would be found there.
 Plus, I am being reflectively defensive to convince you, dear reader, that
 I am not crazy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because why? Because I find that the topics that I wish to talk about are
 so fucking far out there that during ordinary social interactions, I often
 get treated and dismissed as being crazy.
 Which is insulting.
 I am so far out there, that almost everyone I encounter in real life, face–to–f
ace, have never even begun to encounter the ideas I think about.
 And yet, curiously, were I to present these ideas in a number of social–media
 settings, they would be dismissed as being excessively ordinary or quotidian.
 Trot out any of this stuff to Joscha Bach, he would claim all my thoughts
 are so entirely mundane so to be boring.
 So I am caught between two worlds: an intellectual world, where I am at
 best a mundane intellect, and the normie world, where I am so far out there
 that I am nuts.
 Enough.
 I'm self–confident, I can get through this.
 It angers me that I have to be self–defensive about this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If I pull on this thread, it seems to be saying something about Western
 Civ.
 My story of breaking through social norms is hardly unique.
 History is littered with examples: people who persevered against all odds,
 against nay–sayers, to succeed in whatever industry they ended up being
 successful in.
 What is curious about myself is that there won't be any hagiographic biography
 written.
 And yesterday, I met two people who also overcame a combination of personal
 daemons and social suppressions to become intelligent, smart and capable
 members of the advanced layers of intellectual society.
 From this, I conclude that overcoming odds is commonplace.
 And perhaps the journey into self–fulfillment is one that everyone must
 struggle with.
 These are indeed mundane words, a mundane observation.
 Yet it is one that I find to be surprising, so I mull it over, here.
 Just because something is true and is well–known does not prevent it from
 being a surprise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, but a thread of this diary is very much of what is it that might be
 self–fulfillment for an AI, or more abstractly, self–fulfillment for the
 universe itself? Which are also mundane thoughts, well–explored by gurus
 and visionaries throughout the ages, if not the 1970's.
 So again, mundane thoughts, nothing new here.
 A disconnect remains: what should I do next? Should I continue filling
 this diary with mundane thoughts? Should I recap yesterday's thoughts?
 Should I read that paper on diffusion? What a fucking shithole I am in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I plan to go to RedThreadX again, later today, and am doing my morning
 ritual of drinking coffee right now, so this is no a total waste.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another difficult trade–off is whether it is worthwhile to show up to real–world
 events, and whether this is more exciting than the online distractions
 one has.
 Confiding in you, dear diary, is more fun that almost all social interactions
 I engage in.
 This is the marge of a true introvert, who finds social interaction exhausting.
 Do you know how I know this? Because I heard this on some youtube clip.
 I got a little factoid of knowledge from the great dis–intermediator of
 thought, youtube.
 Take that, global brain.
 We are an ant–village.
 The Borg.
 And so now, as a dutiful member of the Borg Collective, what do I do next?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will agonize about the great hijacking of purpose by the Borg Collective.
 Or rather, the harmful environment that modern economic systems have set
 up: number one: video–game addiction, from which both of my sons suffer
 from.
 Well, the good news is that 100 years ago, those same sons would have been
 sent to the trenches of WWI, and died.
 So at least, the socio–economic system has been sufficiently tamed to not
 kill them, outright.
 Well, excepting Ukraine.
 Still, the net effect is not all that different: no procreation, no contributio
n to the economic machinery.
 Much like parasitic leakage of current in an integrated circuit, there
 is socio–economic energy being aimed at young American men, who then promptly
 flush it down the toilet with their video–game addiction.
 A short circuit, of sorts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let me briefly review my current understanding of this.
 The human brain has a variety of mechanisms, interacting, reinforcing,
 operating at different time–scales and strengths, forming a complex network
 metabolome to accomplish what it has been nominally designed by natural
 selection to accomplish: to survive in the wild.
 Capitalism has learned how to hijack that limbic system, under the guise
 of offering the consumer what they want.
 It continues to fine–tune: one of the RedThreadX talks yesterday was about
 connecting sports fans to athletes, via branded clothing, video clips,
 merch, ticket sales.
 Suck money out of the pockets of the sports fan, deliver some of it to
 the sports star, and the rest of it into the entrepreneurial world of venture
 capital and investments, constantly on the prowl to find yet other places
 to suck money out, under the guise of offering the consumer what they want.
 As if we ever knew what we wanted.
 Everyone is asleep, all the time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, let me connect the dots in the last paragraph, before I move on: what
 is being subverted is some desire of running through the forest, swinging
 through trees like monkeys, because this is pleasurable, and it is pleasurable,
 because you do this to escape predators in the wild.
 And you escape predators because evolution has selected for long–lived
 individuals can do this.
 So the entire sports industry is built on top of an evolutionary drive
 for surviving in the wild.
 And one must do that, because the future is unpredictable: evolution is
 trapped in the here and now, just like you and I are: Evolution creates
 complex dynamic systems, because this is how complex dynamic systems survive
 into the future.
 Rather than dissipating into bland, uniformly distributed, perfectly ergodic
 mush.
 The physics of here–and–now has given us evolution, which provides stable
 systems able to span long timer periods.
 It equips individuals with collections of traits enabling survival: complex
 entanglements of neurons and neuro–transmitters, systems that make sports
 pleasurable.
 And capitalism has learned how to take the please of sports, and turn it
 into a passive experience of watching games on TV, and buying merch.
 Well, the RedThreadX talk was very much about how TV is passe, and the
 new technologies that replace the old, passive TV engagement.
