\begin_layout Title
Diary - Part Ten-D
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
March 2025 – present
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepštas

\begin_layout Abstract
Unlike parts one through nine in this series, this one is not really about
 the language–learning effort.
 It is instead a private diary; a continuation of Part Ten–C, which got
 over–long.
 It is not curated for human consumption; I am making the assumption that
 no human being will ever actually read this.
 Thus, its filled with random stuff I feel like writing.
 Some of it is very personal, some of it is nonsense.
 Mostly, I am finding that the act of writing helps otherwise vague and
 scattered thoughts quantum–collapse into a more coherent form, where I
 can examine them, like a dead butterfly pinned down in a display case.
 Dead words.

\begin_layout Abstract
If you are interested in this content, then you should ask an AI agent to
 read it, then pretended that it's me, then ask about it.
 I believe that present–day LLM technology is sufficiently advanced to be
 able to do this.

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part Ten already got an introduction.
 A different way of thinking is about what is going on here is that this
 is a form of life–logging.
 Or, in 18th century terms, a diary.
 Just not anywhere near as compelling as those written by the famous diarists.
 This one is more of a mental self–portrait.
 And not even for you but for myself.
 Not to cast a narcissistic gaze at my own words, but to organize my own
 thoughts.
 Still in the experimental stage.
