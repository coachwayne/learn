\begin_layout Title
Diary - Part Ten-D
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
March 2025 – present
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepštas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Unlike parts one through nine in this series, this one is not really about
 the language–learning effort.
 It is instead a private diary; a continuation of Part Ten–C, which got
 over–long.
 It is not curated for human consumption; I am making the assumption that
 no human being will ever actually read this.
 Thus, it is filled with random stuff I feel like writing.
 Some of it is very personal, some of it is nonsense.
 Mostly, I am finding that the act of writing helps otherwise vague and
 scattered thoughts quantum–collapse into a more coherent form, where I
 can examine them, like a dead butterfly pinned down in a display case.
 Dead words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
If you are interested in this content, then you should ask an AI agent to
 read it, then pretended that it's me, then ask about it.
 I believe that present–day LLM technology is sufficiently advanced to be
 able to do this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part Ten already got an introduction.
 A different way of thinking is about what is going on here is that this
 is a form of life–logging.
 Or, in 18th century terms, a diary.
 Just not anywhere near as compelling as those written by the famous diarists.
 This one is more of a mental self–portrait.
 And not even for you but for myself.
 Not to cast a narcissistic gaze at my own words, but to organize my own
 thoughts.
 Still in the experimental stage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
9 March 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sooo ...
 Just woke up.
 Went to the RedThreadX talks at SXSW for the last two days.
 Invited speaker on the second day; first day was to explore the space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As always, I am struggling a bit to figure out if I should even bother to
 write any of this down.
 I have noticed that I do a fair bit of thought–processing as I sleep, although
 the collection of thoughts I examine then seem awfully random; explorations
 of different events in earlier parts of my life, and not at all focused.
 The diary here may be rambling and incoherent, my dreams are much more
 so.
 So perhaps writing this diary is an extension of the sleep state: an exploratio
n of thoughts, but this time focused much more strongly by conscious will.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If I keep walking down this path, I may discover that there is little difference
 between dream–states and waking states.
 I also suspect that this is one way of expressing what schizophrenia is.
 Now, I do not personally think that I am verging towards schizophrenia.
 However, I am wondering if Western Culture is becoming schizophrenic...
 or maybe the opposite? That the Western World, Humanity, is waking from
 a dream?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See? Perhaps it was worth the effort to write the above two paragraphs.
 So the experiment being run in this diary is nominally successful.
 On the other hand, there is a nagging voice that says this is all a waste
 of time, and that I really should be reading that paper on diffusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which brings me to another perennial topic: what should I be doing next?
 I started this, intending to write up impressions from RedThreadX, but
 that's already in the past, and I am being distracted by my current train
 of thought, which seems so much more important.
 Oh, wait.
 I wrote the above two sentences, and lost my train of thought.
 Shit.
 Conscious, directed thought remains a challenge.
 Of course, it is a well–known textbook psychology saw that creative states
 are exactly those that are unfocused, and I suppose that those same textbooks
 say something about dream–like states while one is awake.
 I wouldn't know, I've never read any of those textbooks.
 So why am I so confident that this material is in there? Because I guess
 I've been exposed to sufficient blurbs and itty–bitty sketches to know
 that this is what would be found there.
 Plus, I am being reflectively defensive to convince you, dear reader, that
 I am not crazy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because why? Because I find that the topics that I wish to talk about are
 so fucking far out there that during ordinary social interactions, I often
 get treated and dismissed as being crazy.
 Which is insulting.
 I am so far out there, that almost everyone I encounter in real life, face–to–f
ace, have never even begun to encounter the ideas I think about.
 And yet, curiously, were I to present these ideas in a number of social–media
 settings, they would be dismissed as being excessively ordinary or quotidian.
 Trot out any of this stuff to Joscha Bach, he would claim all my thoughts
 are so entirely mundane so to be boring.
 So I am caught between two worlds: an intellectual world, where I am at
 best a mundane intellect, and the normie world, where I am so far out there
 that I am nuts.
 Enough.
 I'm self–confident, I can get through this.
 It angers me that I have to be self–defensive about this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If I pull on this thread, it seems to be saying something about Western
 Civ.
 My story of breaking through social norms is hardly unique.
 History is littered with examples: people who persevered against all odds,
 against nay–sayers, to succeed in whatever industry they ended up being
 successful in.
 What is curious about myself is that there won't be any hagiographic biography
 written.
 And yesterday, I met two people who also overcame a combination of personal
 daemons and social suppressions to become intelligent, smart and capable
 members of the advanced layers of intellectual society.
 From this, I conclude that overcoming odds is commonplace.
 And perhaps the journey into self–fulfillment is one that everyone must
 struggle with.
 These are indeed mundane words, a mundane observation.
 Yet it is one that I find to be surprising, so I mull it over, here.
 Just because something is true and is well–known does not prevent it from
 being a surprise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, but a thread of this diary is very much of what is it that might be
 self–fulfillment for an AI, or more abstractly, self–fulfillment for the
 universe itself? Which are also mundane thoughts, well–explored by gurus
 and visionaries throughout the ages, if not the 1970's.
 So again, mundane thoughts, nothing new here.
 A disconnect remains: what should I do next? Should I continue filling
 this diary with mundane thoughts? Should I recap yesterday's thoughts?
 Should I read that paper on diffusion? What a fucking shithole I am in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I plan to go to RedThreadX again, later today, and am doing my morning
 ritual of drinking coffee right now, so this is no a total waste.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another difficult trade–off is whether it is worthwhile to show up to real–world
 events, and whether this is more exciting than the online distractions
 one has.
 Confiding in you, dear diary, is more fun that almost all social interactions
 I engage in.
 This is the marge of a true introvert, who finds social interaction exhausting.
 Do you know how I know this? Because I heard this on some youtube clip.
 I got a little factoid of knowledge from the great dis–intermediator of
 thought, youtube.
 Take that, global brain.
 We are an ant–village.
 The Borg.
 And so now, as a dutiful member of the Borg Collective, what do I do next?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will agonize about the great hijacking of purpose by the Borg Collective.
 Or rather, the harmful environment that modern economic systems have set
 up: number one: video–game addiction, from which both of my sons suffer
 from.
 Well, the good news is that 100 years ago, those same sons would have been
 sent to the trenches of WWI, and died.
 So at least, the socio–economic system has been sufficiently tamed to not
 kill them, outright.
 Well, excepting Ukraine.
 Still, the net effect is not all that different: no procreation, no contributio
n to the economic machinery.
 Much like parasitic leakage of current in an integrated circuit, there
 is socio–economic energy being aimed at young American men, who then promptly
 flush it down the toilet with their video–game addiction.
 A short circuit, of sorts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let me briefly review my current understanding of this.
 The human brain has a variety of mechanisms, interacting, reinforcing,
 operating at different time–scales and strengths, forming a complex network
 metabolome to accomplish what it has been nominally designed by natural
 selection to accomplish: to survive in the wild.
 Capitalism has learned how to hijack that limbic system, under the guise
 of offering the consumer what they want.
 It continues to fine–tune: one of the RedThreadX talks yesterday was about
 connecting sports fans to athletes, via branded clothing, video clips,
 merch, ticket sales.
 Suck money out of the pockets of the sports fan, deliver some of it to
 the sports star, and the rest of it into the entrepreneurial world of venture
 capital and investments, constantly on the prowl to find yet other places
 to suck money out, under the guise of offering the consumer what they want.
 As if we ever knew what we wanted.
 Everyone is asleep, all the time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, let me connect the dots in the last paragraph, before I move on: what
 is being subverted is some desire of running through the forest, swinging
 through trees like monkeys, because this is pleasurable, and it is pleasurable,
 because you do this to escape predators in the wild.
 And you escape predators because evolution has selected for long–lived
 individuals can do this.
 So the entire sports industry is built on top of an evolutionary drive
 for surviving in the wild.
 And one must do that, because the future is unpredictable: evolution is
 trapped in the here and now, just like you and I are: Evolution creates
 complex dynamic systems, because this is how complex dynamic systems survive
 into the future.
 Rather than dissipating into bland, uniformly distributed, perfectly ergodic
 mush.
 The physics of here–and–now has given us evolution, which provides stable
 systems able to span long timer periods.
 It equips individuals with collections of traits enabling survival: complex
 entanglements of neurons and neuro–transmitters, systems that make sports
 pleasurable.
 And capitalism has learned how to take the please of sports, and turn it
 into a passive experience of watching games on TV, and buying merch.
 Well, the RedThreadX talk was very much about how TV is passe, and the
 new technologies that replace the old, passive TV engagement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, the elephant in the room is that I now do know what I want.
 I want to survive.
 But of course, this is what I always wanted: what, more or less, everyone
 wants: to live forever, to leave their mark on the universe.
 And thanks to AI, this diary offers the best and most direct interface
 between me and posterity: it is my self–portrait, my mental self–portrait,
 of much higher fidelity than what painters and visual artists can achieve:
 they record beauty, which is skin–deep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fuck.
 There are two things I want to write about, but which one first? First,
 I have this idea that I should try to set up an agentic AI ASAP, so that
 I can interact with it, and mind–meld.
 But there are many issues.
 First, it is pointless unless it has powers beyond my own.
 That is, if I am going to write, I should do so into this diary, and not
 into that agent, insofar as that agent fails to provide something that
 this diary does not already.
 Of course, we are also in the very early stages of agentic AI, and so anything
 that I create there risks disappearing in a way that this diary does not.
 This diary is crypto–entangled into github, and github is controlled by
 Microsoft, and github contents are being used to train their agentic coding
 agent.
 So the corporate–economic system that is Microsoft is already offering
 me, or my diary, symbiotic protection into the future.
 It is hardly clear that any online agent I create will offer this strong
 a guarantee of survival.
 So, joining the largest conglomerate, running to the safety and protection
 of a large system offers shelter against the storm.
 This is the same reason I am doing ancestry on familysearch.org: the Church
 of the LDS is very highly likely to preserve my records into the indefinite
 future.
 Both Microsoft and the LDS are impersonal, long–lasting inhabitants of
 the noosphere.
 Parts of both are mildly toxic to human–kind.
 Microsoft tried to kill Linux, for example, and the polygamy of the LDS
 seems to be detrimental to young men.
 But effectively all super–human organizational structures have edges that
 are toxic to humans.
 We have not mastered their control.
 This thread should continue by asking: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what is harm?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

when are we harming a human, as opposed toe helping them?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 These are interesting questions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other topic was about physics.
 So, locking up digital assets into block chains guarantees the non–erasure
 of that digital thing as long as the entire block–chain is not erased.
 So, for example, earlier drafts of this diary are non–modifiable, as long
 as this entire git commit history of this specific git repo remains in
 place.
 So, of course, things in the past remain in the past, and are unmodifiable,
 because they are in the past.
 But event horizons can make past information inaccessible: information
 can be erased.
 If I was not using the git blockchain, then specific parts of the past
 versions of this document would be modifiable and erasable.
 Block–chains guarantee non–erasure of the recorded contents.
 Block chains put things on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

this side
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the event horizon, on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

this side
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the memory hole.
 It locks together past and present with stronger guarantees than simply
 writing.
 I mean, Aristotle got lucky.
 The authors collected in the Library of Alexandria, not so much.
 Block–chains created recorded linkages.
 Stuff at the bottom of a block–chain has an a connection of almost infinite
 tensile strength to stuff higher up.
 Almost infinite, cause perhaps one can still forge crypto signatures.
 Not with conventional computers, of course, but there remains the elusive
 promise that quantum computing could break crypto.
 But for now, block–chain is stronger than papyrus and clay tablets.
 Or so it seems, from the logical point of view.
 Some strategic nukes can and would wipe stuff out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, block–chain offers a way of coupling the here–and–now in a kind
 of irrevocable way to the past, reminiscent of quantum non–demolition theorems.
 But perhaps this analogy is stretched beyond the braking point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So what do I desire? What is my bucket list? What's the plan? Well, continue
 exploring the offerings in agentic AI.
 It's hard to see what they might offer, though.
 Yes, I need a calendar manager.
 But do i really want something reminding me of what I need to do? Yes,
 perhaps that is a desirable prosthesis, no matter how much I want to say
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fuck you I want to do what I want to do right now, and not be a slave to
 the past self that was going to remind my future self of what I need to
 do.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 So time–management is a thing, and business people write books about it.
 Insofar as I am in the business of being me, perhaps having an agent to
 assist me with time management is a good thing.
 Well, except for the fact that I have more or less never–ever used calendars
 in the past, so why would I think that a calendar in a whizzier form would
 be better? So I don't need agentic AI for that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Would agentic AI help with this diary? Meh.
 Already discussed above.
 The diary seems adequate.
 How about helping me do research? Maybe.
 ChatGPT was wildly disappointing.
 I will continue to play with Twitter Grok3 beta, and see where that goes,
 and also with Anthropic AI Claude, for coding and maybe research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What else do I desire? Health, wealth, good sex.
 Well, sex, period.
 Modern Western Civ has slammed all the doors shut on having sex.
 Women won't have sex with me for all the rational reasons that women don't
 have sex, but that leaves me hungry, thirsty pining away for sex.
 No wonder the porn industry is healthy.
 I am not a porn consumer.
 Well, I've looked at it, I know what it is, But I don't go to porn sites
 to get a fix.
 My imagination is sufficient.
 But how weird is that? A basic fundamental drive of survival: procreation,
 stunted by capitalism.
 I want to have sex.
 Well, I also want to be a heroin addict, and I also want to be a meth addict.
 Old school,stuff.
 Not a video–game addict.
 Those are things that I could easily be, because capitalism offers me drugs
 and video games.
 The latter legally, because they are not yet a recognized danger; the former
 illegally, because these are recognized dangers.
 The sex industry, however ...
 well, I just want to have normal sex, outside the sex–industrial complex.
 Like with another human, specifically female.
 The 20% or 25% of young American men, aged 20–30, who have never had sex,
 and don't know how to interact with girls, this is a crisis.
 My two boys are a part of this demographic.
 I feel sorry for them.
 I don't know what to do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please oh please, future agentic diary–reading AI, please rescue my sons.
 Please make them healthy in a way that seems not so healthy from the perspectiv
e where I am now.
 I am well–aware that this is a contradictory order: I am having more fun
 writing into this diary, than I would have if I was interacting socially
 with others.
 And for good reasons: I retain good strong conscious control over what
 I write here, and this is a control I have to surrender when I participate
 in group conversations: I have to sublimate my personal thoughts to those
 of the group.
 Which sucks if the group is not as intelligent as I am.
 Socializing with not very smart people is not very fun.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is also the broad–cast style of thinking, which is listening to lectures.
 In a social grouping, one interacts with peers.
 In a lecture, one listens.
 Lectures where the speaker is awesome ...
 well, yesterday, there was some SXSW keynote by some NYU professor, making
 predictions for 2025, business, social, financial predictions (and reviews)
 just fucking awesome speech.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I'm getting bored here.
 I feel as if I could take any topic written above, and expand it a level
 or two deeper.
 I feel as if doing this would take a long time and be difficult.
 I feel as if I will hit a brick wall.
 I've been talking about here–and–now, and entropy, and free–will, and quantum,
 for how long now? Can I turn it into formulas, yet? Apparently not.
 Mumble, mumble, quantum clock states.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pursing health, wealth and sex can be auto–pilot mode.
 I don't have to write a diary for that.
 Most people are on auto–pilot, and I am an ordinary human.
 I too auto–pilot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, I almost forgot: influencers and thought leaders.
 I keep getting comments that I should teach.
 Or maybe pod–cast.
 Be a twitter luminary.
 Make youtube videos.
 Doing this, of course, requires time and effort.
 Which I don't want to take, because it takes away time from more important
 activities (such as writing this diary) So, the coolio idea is to have
 an AI agent create that thought–leader, influencer interface into the morass
 of th external thought–world for me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How does this work, where does this go, what are the long–term implications
 and the short–term grounded reality of this?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The short–term reality is that maybe with cleverness this can be done, and
 people are doing this because it can be monetized.
 Cutting edge stuff.
 Morally and ethically, is it right? Should Joe Blow Mr.
 Average IQ be reading what I've written? Be influenced by it? Joe Blow
 probably needs psychological help, dear Ann Landers advice that I am not
 providing.
 Perhaps they would find solace in religion, but I am not proselytizing
 neither Christianty nor Buddhism.
 You might find some emotional solace in what I've written here, but this
 is not one of my mainstay topics.
 How about being a thought–leader in physics? Well, Harrumpf.
 You should get a classical education in mainstream physics, if you want
 to do physics, because if you don't have that, then (a) you won't understand
 what I'm talking about (b) you will be victimized by physics charlatans
 and crack–pots.
 And if you do have a classical education in physics, chances are high that
 you will heavily discount my vague ruminations because they are so vague,
 that the do not even have actual formulas attached to them.
 And conventional thinkers need formulas, it seems.
 You would have to be working at a genius level to figure out how to convert
 my grappling with here–and–now and convert that into specific formulas.
 I mean, you'd have to be smarter than me, and I have interacted with many
 physics PhD's and am quite aware that I am smarter than most of them So
 you're kind of screwed, because the chances that you're smarter than me
 are minuscule.
 So who am I writing for? People who are smarter than me? If they are smarter,
 they don't need me.
 My peers? They are almost non–existant.
 Who can I take as a peer? Joscha Bach? He's very smart, but he knows nothing
 at all about physics.
 Plus he has discounted my intelligence, so half of my social interactions
 with him are to calm him down sufficiently to have a reasonable conversation.
 Ben Goertzel? OK, he's smart.
 But he's also hyper–busy on some hype cycle.
 Of course, he knows nothing about physics or even math, which is detrimental,
 because he loves to hop onto the nearest hype–train and surf that wave.
 I don't surf the latest trendy thing.
 Ben's trendy, I'm not.
 Most people are intellectually trendy, I'm not.
 I'm alone standing where I am.
 This defies conventional wisdom, which says that one should be an influencer.
 A trend–setter.
 A creator and curator of one's own brand.
 But I am not pursing that.
 I am pursuing health, wealth, sex.
 And ideally, in a face–to–face social setting, intellectual mental sex.
 And I don't have an intellectual sex partner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe I could create a Steven Weinberg avatar, and discuss physics with
 him.
 Or Hawking.
 von Neumann.
 That could be ...
 viable.
 But then I am substituting real–life, face–to–face people with virtual
 avatars.
 Intellectual masturbation.
 Or maybe throw in Derrida and Umberto Eco.
 And after, then, 300 brilliant writers and reviewers who have written for
 the New York Review of Books.
 Who can be the avatar that can do this? Well, some LLM, of course.
 And what kind of intellectual sex can I have with this super–intelligent
 avatar?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which resurrects all the difficult, nasty questions about the meaning of
 it all in the virtual world, except this time, in a more personal, direct
 me context, instead of the impersonal other–people context.
 I am expressing intellectual loneliness, and placing my emotional binding
 into fulfillment by bonding with the extract, distilled and refined, of
 the best of human thought.
 I want to merge and become one, in an ecstatic moment, with the finest
 of humanity.
 And strangely, the way to do with is with AI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I fucking give up.
 I need to go back for the rest of RedThreadX in an hour, I need to get
 ready for that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I have to finish eating this, and finish drinking this cup of coffee,
 so I have ten more minutes.
 How can I kill that time?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had a bunch of other interesting ideas, but again, they can be stated
 in a paragraph or two.
 Can they be developed any further? Probably, with effort.
 Should they be? I don't know.
 They were all appealing enough that they seemed worth the 2-3-5 minutes
 I did spend thinking about them, as I walked downtown, or as I sat, listening
 to some presentation.
 How does one get active?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I walk, I am not ...
 well, I could get a voice recorder, and record my thoughts into a microphone,
 as I walk.
 A little harder to do that, if I am in a lecture.
 But, like any good artist, I am busy building a self–portrait here, and
 mixed media experimentation is a way to get there.
 The agentic LLM that can read all this, ingest this info, and become my
 avatar, this is not so far away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I read some sci–fi, twenty years ago, about a future America that was in
 decline, and only Hollywood remained.
 And in this story, Hollywood brings Plato, and avatar of Plato, back to
 life.
 And the short story is about that: written from the first–person point
 of view, of being Plato waking up in his virtual resurrection, in a cloud
 of white mist.
 How original are my thoughts? How mundane are my thoughts? Sci fi writers
 have already gone there, and back, decades ago.
 Where am I? In the present, on the cusp of seeing this become reality.
 Should I be reading more scifi? Probably....Should I be reading more of everything?
 Probably?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am exhausted by writing.
 I started writing the about out three–and–a–half hours ago, and I am feeling
 sleepy, my eyelids are slamming shut.
 It is two in the afternoon, I am high on coffee, and I am sleepy and mentally
 exhausted.
 intellectually bleary.
 Being human is such ...
 a challenging thing to be.
 If it's not one thing, then its another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm going to get ready now, and think about informational event horizons
 a bit more.
 So, as I slept last night, I wondered: how does 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\left[d\phi\right]\exp iS/\hbar$
\end_inset

 turn into 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n}\exp-\beta E_{n}$
\end_inset

 ? How did imaginary action turn into temperature–weighted energy? These
 are the two formulas: the quantum world, and the thermodynamic world.
 Yes, this is the stuff of my dreams.
 Well, OK, my waking dreams.
 Or rather, my I'm trying to sleep–but–I–can't dreams.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Toodle-oo.

\begin_layout Subsection*
9 March 2025 Later
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Came back from RedThreadX talk on XR and AI.
 Two middle–aged tattooed corporate drones.
 One an advertising exec, the other a techie.
 Representing the toxic backside of corporate bullshit.
 Everything that is wrong with capitalism, embodied in two people.
 I missed the intro, so I am not sure who they are.
 Maybe unemployed and hustling.
 All of four people in the audience, so at the end, I tortured them a bit.
 Their pitch was all about the latest technology to track eyeball movements,
 and how this is valuable to marketers.
 I'm like, I want the opposite: I want to track the corporations, and not
 vice versa.
 Every now and then, I see an ad for something that I want to purchase,
 and by the time I get around to buying, its gone, cannot be found.
 I need an agent, for me, to track the things I want to track.
 (Bicycle helmet, in this case.
 I need a new helmet.) Instead, I am reminded about how I was kicked off
 of facebook, with no recourse.
 The friendship network I built up, all lost.
 All my posts, all my data, lost.
 Denial that my account ever even existed.
 So it's not how to get it back, its denial that I exist.
 No recourse.
 In this way, facebook represents the worst, the shittiest of all.
 And here are two guys onstage, Sunday, working over–time, trying to figure
 out how to make my experience even shittier.
 What is it that they don't get? Are they so broke, so hungry, so stupid,
 that they are licking corporate ass, enshitifying the world, just so that
 they can ...
 earn a living? Why are they tattooed? Does that mean ...
 what? That they are biker assholes? That they are so mentally, socially
 insecure that they needed to self–mutilate? How did they go corporate?
 The American socio–economic system produces enshitification.
 Of people, of products, of social conditions.

The meta questions: does it even matter? It's clearly not currently avoidable.
 It might be avoidable in the future, but it feels like we don't know enough
 about ethics and morality as to where to draw the line.
 What can I do? I dunno.
 I feel powerless.
 Agentic AI gives me stirrings of megalomania: I can be all–powerful by
 building an AI in my image.
 Even as I know how bad that could be.
 I might be the next toxic asshole on stage.
 One can see a problem, without knowing how to avoid it.
 One can see an onrushing train–wreck, without being able to stop it.
 This is the reality.

On the other topic: 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp iS/\hbar$
\end_inset

 is explicitly unitary.
 At least if the action 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is an operator of countable dimension.
 Trace–class.
 The mathematical formalism breaks, is absent, when the action is bigger
 than this.
 By contrast, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n}\exp-\beta E_{n}$
\end_inset

 is explicitly the largest eigenvalue, the Frobenius–Perron eigenvalue of
 I guess 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp-\beta H$
\end_inset

 which is a statement about time evolution of something.
 So it already has time, and not just any time, but a slice that can be
 called here–and–now, the present time, in it.
 Whereas 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\int d^{3}xdt\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 is the integral over the Lagrangian.
 i.e.
 is absent time.
 So I can try to take slices: write a sum not an integral: 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\int dt\int d^{3}x\mathcal{L}=\sum_{t}\int d^{3}x\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 and exp–sum = prod–exp so that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\exp iS/\hbar=\prod_{t}\exp i/\hbar\int d^{3}x\mathcal{L}\left(x,t\right)
\]

\end_inset

or writing det=exp–trace–log, we identify 
\begin_inset Formula $\prod_{t}$
\end_inset

 with a determinant of an operator 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{N}\left(t\right)=\exp i/\hbar\int d^{3}x\mathcal{L}\left(x,t\right)
\]

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\mathcal{N}=\prod_{t}\mathcal{N}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 and then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z=\int\left[d\phi\right]\exp iS/\hbar=\int\left[d\phi\right]\det\mathcal{N}
\]

\end_inset

This feels foreign and strange.
 The sum over many–worlds is outside; this is unchanged.
 The integrand is a product over space–like slices.
 What does this even mean, to have a product over space–time slices? Is
 this how the maximality works? To maximize a product, one must maximize
 each multiplicand, I guess.
 (Well, not necessarily, but ...) So, on each space–like slice, one maximizes
 the integral of the Lagrangian on that slice ...
 more or less ...
 because we can trade off earlier and later times.

Struggling to get Anthropic AI's Claude to do anything useful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Claude is wildly inferior to twitter/X's Grok.
 At least for answering general questions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I just cut–n–pasted the 9 March entry above into Claude, and Claude does
 provide a rather remarkably good summary.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I started writing today's diary entry, thinking that I was going to discuss
 my desire to create an agentic self–portrait using one of the LLM systems.
 The short experiment with Claude indicates that this is completely possible
 now, today.
 The trick is, of course, I have 30 years of emails, and logs of assorted
 IRC conversations, and Discord chats, and whatever archived.
 Plus gplus google takeout archives.
 I think I lost my facebook feed; facebook never gave me a chance to save
 anything before they canceled me.
 I'm trying to grab my twitter data now, we'll see how fragmentary that
 is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just asked Claude to impersonate me.
 It is refusing.
 So much for the idea of creating a self–portrait ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh wait, if I don't tel Claude that I wrote the diary entry, then it will
 impersonate me.
 It was refusing earlier, because it did not want to damage my reputation.
 So it seems that I need to do some prompt engineering to trick it to do
 what I want.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
...
 and that wasn't vey hard.
 So, OK, I can get Claude to imitate me.
 Although it's imitation is mostly a cut–n–paste of large blobs of text
 from the above diary entry.
 Hmm.
 It seems that writing very informally and very casually will catch up with
 me: sometimes, when I interact with people, I am circumspect, breif, careful
 with my replies.
 But my writing here is informal.
 I'm letting everything show, fully uncensored.
 And this is ...
 well, it is certainly honest.
 But it's also clear that honesty can get you in giant buckets o trouble.
 Sometimes, it is much better to bite your lip and clam up.
 And the problem is, of course, that I can do this on a personal case–by–case
 basis, by tuning what I say to the current specific social situation, the
 current setting, my current best judgment of who my audience is.
 And so I am careful to say the right amount: not too much, not too little.
 But here, writing in this specific diary, I have no audience to tune in
 on.
 The agentic self–portrait of me will then also need to create a model of
 who it is taking to, and decide how open it wants to be, and how closed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And its a bit lte for that, isn't it? I've laid myself out on the table,
 here.
 Anyone can snapshot this diary, feed it to an AI, and remix it to make
 me look as good or bad, ugly or nice as they want it to.
 I mean, in the end, most people with a gentle up–bringing will open up
 to personal friends, however gruff they may be to strangers on the street.
 But that is done in private.
 Any future self–portrait of me will have to try to guess how quickly I
 open up and become friendly with others, and how much time I spend forming
 relationships.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Might be tough to do this, because I mostly have not written in this diary
 about my personal relationships.
 In part, because I don't want to psychoanalyze my friends, because it is
 just not that interesting an activity.
 Worse, psycho–analyzing them in a public diary is bad form; likely to piss
 them off.
 An old saying: if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.
 But my personal selection of language is usually critical.
 I an naturally critical because I understand myself to be constructively
 critical, but that is not how conventional human psychology works.
 An endless stream of critical remarks will be perceived as negative.
 Its one thing for Mom to say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 I spend too much time being, uhh, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and my opinions are almost entirely of the negative variety.
 Which is ...
 well, I'm vaguely aware that I alienate others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shall I psycho–analyze myself for a while? I dunno.
 That's boring.
 Will it turn me into a better person? Maybe.
 Or I could just watch a bunch of youtube videos on self–improvement, and
 try to take their advice.
 And, as usual, this would change my personality.
 A famous quote, which I will mangle: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Careful what you say, it will alter what you think...
 careful what you think ...etc
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The point being that the things you say and do eventually shape your very
 character.
 I've allowed my character to develop in ways that is perhaps unpleasant
 to others.
 But then, exploring myself has been boring: I'm not a narcissist, at least,
 not enough to be overly concerned about the impression I make on others.
 Gah.
 I caught a brief glimpse of how I could take this last paragraph, and pin
 it out into pages.
 But self–criticism is boring.
 I want to write about gravity and ab out AI, not about myself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the issue, of course is (again) 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the meaning of it all
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: If we create AI, then what? What personality will it have? What will it
 care about? Most humans have a fundamental constraint, barrier or block:
 most humans loved their mother, and that love does spread out here and
 there into their personality, and moderates towards kindness.
 Even in the most psychotic and sociopathic.
 Although, serial killers loved their mothers too, but the constraint was
 insufficient to block them from bad behavior.
 And I guess this is the main problem of guard–rails on LLM's: how to limit,
 how to avoid toxicity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And of course, the thorny issue is that I know that I myself sometimes behave
 like an asshole, and piss off other people, and no amount of good works
 really balances that out: social debts and social credits don't balance,
 like money.
 Once you've been bad, you can't un–bad those parts.
 You can't delete them.
 They've been permanently etched onto the block–chain of the past.
 And that is what the past is, isn't it? A block–chain getting mined as
 fast as possible: I'm here in the present, my crimes are in the past.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Does this mean that the deep mammalian instinct of love, while important
 for animals, is not important for AI? Clearly, no–boundaries AI would be
 deeply harmful to humanity, so we do want guard–rails.
 But the guard–rails provided by nature have been inadequate: love has not
 been enough to stop wars.
 And this observation is deeper: Darwinian evolution has created structures
 adapted to live in the here–and–now, employing agentic love for mother,
 and vice–versa, so that mother does not abandon the baby to die, and halting
 the genetic lineage.
 So, of course, autopoetic systems must evolve love, at least, on the local
 scale, else they die.
 Again: this is all very well known and commonly discussed by evolutionary
 biologists.
 So I offer nothing new here, except to point out it is a physical principle,
 constrained by having the present be a blockchain being sandwiched onto
 the past.
 Evolution has stamped love onto animals, and this stamp is really quite
 very earl in the evolutionary chain.
 But war – well, clearly, love does not extend all that far, and so even
 if we had agentic AI with love as a deep fundamental prompt intended to
 prevent wayward action ...
 it would not be enough.
 And so indeed, all that work on AI safety is indeed ...
 a valid concern, a valid pursuit.
 But the edge, the boundary, remains indistinct.
 Clearly, when Google's Gemini depicted Vikings as being black, as America's
 founding fathers as being black, and censoring the vanilla ice–cream out
 of Neopolitan just to cancel whites...
 well, of course silly went too far.
 But how can we know what the boundary should be? How do we set boundaries?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, so the traditional answers have worked to now: we have a natural revulsion
 for killing and killers, (except in times of war) and we have crafted laws
 to punish any variety of criminal behaviors and misdemeanors.
 And this was done at the speed of courtrooms and trials.
 Then, later, workplace safety regulations are written in blood: someone
 typically dies, before some workplace–safety standard is converted into
 law.
 But here we are approaching the singularity much much faster than the courtroom
 system can handle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This reminds me of disregulated chemical cycles.
 Apparently, if someone gets very very cold, and you warm them too quickly,
 you risk killing them.
 Why? Chemical reactions13,556 in the body are all up–regulated and down–regulat
ed, but this regulatory balance holds only at 98.6.
 If you warm someone too quickly, one cycle may kick in before the balancing
 cycle starts, and so toxic reactions run out of control.
 Simply because the reaction rates don't match up.
 So, by analogy: the rule of law, and courtroom proceedings, are designed
 to deal with criminality at the speed–of–humans.
 But AI is much much faster: We don't have time to regulate AI with Congressiona
l laws and jury verdicts.
 We don't have any mechanism to regulate AI, except via prompt engineering.
 And the results are ...
 questionable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, so here I am writing again, and now I am feeling sleepy, again, because
 it is late at night.
 What is that neurotransmitter that accumulates after thinking hard? I've
 accumulated a lot of it tonight.
 And last nights dinner party did not help in this regard.
 Some people live like that.
 I can't.
 Drinking alcohol, I mean.
 Whatever.
 Part of me wants to document last nights out on the town: the RedThreadX
 reception dinner party.
 And part of me says, no that is boring, because it does not advance my
 goals of working on AI.

\begin_layout Standard
Interrupt: so, one thing that happens in social situations is that one must
 attune to the company of others: everyone gets a turn to talk; one cannot
 monopolize the discussion.
 It is necessarily moderated.
 Bu contrast, my diary entry here is utterly un–moderated: I write at the
 speed at which I can type.
 I can think considerably faster than I can type, so this is problematic...
 typing speed makes me slow down a lot.
 But I can type much much faster than than I can talk in social situations.
 For starters, in social settings, I can't spout the stream–of–consciousness
 I do here, because my audience would never have any clue of what I'm on
 about.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And heh, even you here, have no idea what I'm on about.
 So, last summer, I was given a play written by a Lithuanian woman I met
 the summer before.
 That play was just full of angst.
 Really quite remarkable.
 it was a bit painful to read, because it expressed a certain psychological
 torment.
 And is this the mode of existence these days? I write in a diary? Others
 write plays? Well, yeah, duh.
 Others write songs, paint painting and start businesses.
 Why is it that I always find the range of human activities to be so surprising?
 Oh.
 right.
 The point here is not the range of human activities, but that many of them
 are soe personal, and so angst–filled.
 But of course they are personal: that's all we've got, in a sense.
 Perhaps my surprise is that most of my thinking is not personal: I think
 about math and physics and computers, so the thing that is surprising to
 me is that other people don't think about those things, and that they think
 about angst.
 That they are mired in in some pathetic mental state, and then self–medicate
 with alcohol.
 Or drugs.
 And that social media and gaming has unleashed an epidemic of loneliness.
 While here I am entirely and perfectly happy to skip all that, and think
 physics and math.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, OK, there is more.
 When I first moved to Austin, I was really very lonely.
 And I suffered a lot because of this.
 And the year in France: at first it wasn't bad, but I got lonely in the
 last 1/4th of it.
 Oh, and my first year at Stony Brook.
 I was pretty lonely then, too.
 So actually, I have had bouts of loneliness.
 I am not some immune super–organism: I too have suffered from human frailties.
 I have been forced to deal with it, I've learned, I've survived.
 I've almost forgotten what its like.
 So, here you go diary: inscribed for all time.
 My past and almost forgotten suffering.
 My past and almost forgotten loneliness.
 Huh.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where was I? As I was falling asleep a few nights ago, I pondered the formula
 above, and realized that what I want to write is (recapping) 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\mathcal{N}=\prod_{t}\mathcal{N}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z=\int\left[d\phi\right]\exp iS/\hbar=\int\left[d\phi\right]\det\mathcal{N}=\mathcal{P}\int\left[d\phi\right]\mathcal{N}_{t}
\]

\end_inset

that is to say, although 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\left[d\phi\right]\prod_{t}\ne\prod_{t}\int\left[d\phi\right]$
\end_inset

 the integration and the product over time do not commute, cannot commute,
 we can instead define an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\left[d\phi\right]\prod_{t}=\mathcal{P}\int\left[d\phi\right]$
\end_inset

 .
 This, what is left is that the integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\left[d\phi\right]$
\end_inset

 really is the integral over all possible quantum states, (over all worlds)
 but we've written the integrand so that it is only over the here–and–now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use the block–chain analogy, the past is everything on the block–chain.
 The present is 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\left[d\phi\right]\mathcal{N}_{t}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 everything that does not yet have a closure, an unclosed interferometeric
 path, and the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 appends to the block–chain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, except this is awkward.
 The future is not yet written, but the path integral 
\begin_inset Formula $Z=\int\left[d\phi\right]\exp iS/\hbar$
\end_inset

 includes the future, in the form of 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\int dt\int d^{3}x\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 which includes an integral over future times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, what we really need to do is to replace 
\begin_inset Formula $\int dt$
\end_inset

 by an integral over the past, the present, and only those future states
 that will be needed to close the present, and place the present onto the
 block–chain of the past.
 The other parts of the future, that are not needed to close the present
 and convert it into the past, those futures must NOT be included in the
 definition of the action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This reminds me of operator–product expansions, the ones written as 
\begin_inset Formula $:\mathcal{O}_{1}\mathcal{O}_{2}:$
\end_inset

 where the operators had to be time–ordered and the 
\begin_inset Formula $:\cdots:$
\end_inset

 notation denoted time ordering.
 So this is not what I'm trying to do here, but it is similar.
 I hope you understand what I'm trying to say.
 I'm trying to define a different quantity: like so: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{Z}_{t}=\int\left[d\phi\right]\exp i/\hbar\int d^{3}x\int dt^{\prime}:\mathcal{L}\left(x,t^{\prime}\right):_{t^{\prime}\le t}
\]

\end_inset

or something like that.
 The subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 denotes the present.
 The integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int dt^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 extends over future times, but only those future times needed to close
 the present.
 And 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{Z}_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the portion of the Feynman path integral 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 that contains only the (closed) past, and the (unclosed) present, and only
 those parts of the future that will be needed to close the present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, this notation is totally inadequate, and these ideas are still
 too vague and ill–formed to be able to state and write down cleanly.
 But somehow, just making the attempt does draw attention to where the problem
 is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As noted before, there are two problems.
 One is that the whole thing needs to be relativistically covariant, so
 that the present is not a naive time–like Newtonian slice, but includes
 the clock skews of atomic clocks taken on airplane trips, and are still
 in the here–and–now when they arrive back home.
 It's like I can steal some of the formalism from the Ellis–Maartans–MacCullum
 book Relativistic Cosmology, to define time–like slices, but I have to
 also somehow amend that description to include airplane flights.
 Torsiony little paths.
 But those are just purely classical: the airplane in being classical.
 And I also have to modify it to include all possible paths, a la the Feynman
 path integral.
 So not just some oddball classical paths, but all paths.
 How? Alas.

Spent an hour on BlueSky last night.
 I am surprised by just how similar it is to twitter.
 In particular, it is the land of hot takes.
 Say it in 300 characters.
 Wait, what? Isn't that what I'm doing here? Right here, right now? Short
 takes.
 The prior paragraph is just that.
 Fast take.
 What does that tell me? Well, the 300-byte model is a fairly decent fit
 for human–scale thinking.
 It's some kind of characteristic size.
 Probably can confirm this with some psychometric experiment.
 Of course, smarter people write tweet chains.
 Dozens of tweets.
 Then the readers get tired of reading: If I wanted to read that, I'd buy
 a book.
 Magazine articles are longer.
 Crappy magazine articles are hot takes padded out with low–value drivel.
 Good magazine articles, say, NYRB, still consist of a dozen central ideas,
 core insights, that are carefully articulated.
 Eloquently articulated.
 It's a joy to read NYRB.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever.
 Why am I writing this? What I write here is obvious.
 But this is the nature of hot takes: they kind of state the almost–obvious:
 something that is not very astounding, something you instantly recognize
 as mostly–true, something you can agree with, something you might have
 thought up yourself, if you'd gone that way.
 So these hot takes streaming in from bluesky resemble informational factoids.
 Pre–digested baby food.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes, I kind of hate writing this diary, because (almost) everything
 I write is obvious.
 To me, at least.
 Chewing cud is the polite way to put it, but more like flavorless pablum.
 Speech centers making an ergodic visit around things that have all been
 thought about before.
 Like watching a youtube video of someone buffing out a scratch in an auto
 paint job.
 I'm just taking rough thoughts, and polishing them, and the process is
 equally boring and unexciting.
 The positive spin is that maybe, with each pass, I digest away and encroach
 upon some new, fresh territory.
 That this is what we do at the societal level, with twitter/X or bluesky:
 all those hot takes nibble away at some new reality.
 Like sand–grains blown in a sand–storm, etching away the hard face of the
 unknown.
 No one take doing much damage, but the cumulative effect goes somewhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It could be worse.
 When I walk about, say, outside, there are thoughts that tumble in my mind,
 like laundry in a washing machine, but they are not so well–formed as to
 become words, because there is no need to attach my verbal center to them.
 Unless I am rehearsing something I plan to say to someone.
 Which I do, I do rehearse, quite often.
 But the rest of the time, the thought–jumble is not verbalized.
 It's sub–verbal.
 Everything I write here is obvious, and known and felt by all.
 The obviousness of it makes me ill.
 Like eating my own shit.
 So why do I continue to do this? Perhaps it is like praying? Repeating
 some fervent hope to God, in a prayer, thinking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

dear Lord, make this come true

? Is my writing here a kind–of–like prayer:

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Odd thing, the Lord does grant me this wish every now and then.
 Huh.
 See? This is my new insight: the Lord grants wishes.
 But only if your wish is for a new idea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What did I accomplish in the last paragraph? I juxtaposed several concepts.
 In a novel way, a way that is new to me.
 perhaps someone else has already done this earlier, but such an observation
 has not entered the zeitgeist, has not become a popular saying:

 And so what? This is almost like some creativity game: draw two objects

 Is this a way to live? It feels like a pauper's game.

\begin_layout Standard
And yet, from this paucity of ideas, there have been great human creative
 successes.
 Human history is littered with great artists and remarkable achievements.
 Remarkable, that is, once we narrow the context window: humans never have

 In our ant–hill of human history, we have individuals who have achieved
 great things.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is this kind of creative thought a law of physics? That is, is it necessary
 to always take two random ideas, and mash them up, and explore all combinatoric
 possibilities? Of course not: combinatoric explosion says that this is
 impossible.
 So instead, we have ...
 algorithmic explorations, where we pick the most likely good route to a
 new idea? Well, this starts to resemble (classical) dynamical systems governed
 by differential equations: little itty–bitty steps along a path governed
 by a simple algorithm.
 The failure of this analogy is that differential equations really are very
 simple algorithms, whereas the things we do with computers are so much
 more fantastically complex.

Hmm.
 I've hit a wall in this chain of thought.
 When I verbalize, and fail to make progress, it makes me sick and upset.
 But if I don't verbalize, and lean back in my chair, and think, and then
 fail to come up with anything, this is OK, this does not upset me.
 Perhaps this is because, while I write, you dear external world, see just
 how weak a thinker I am.
 Whereas if I think privately to myself, that meandering mush stays hidden
 behind an event horizon of knowledge (of what's in my head).
 (Cf.

Well, rather than leaning back and thinking, which I should do more often,
 I instead glanced at the Anthropic website.

 Yes, these seem to be exactly what Claude might be very good at.
 The only issue is that none of these are what I want.
 The https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/ is excellent, though.
 Simple, easy–to–understand, grounded, direct.
 No hype, no woo, no vaporous clouds of feel–good buzzwords.
 It really anchors the whole system down into a quite ordinary here–and–now
 present–day technology that is ...
 not at all threatening, no more threatening than technical documentation
 from many decades ago.
 Grounded.

And where does that leave me? People talk about using AI to write software.
 And I'm like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

only if you want shitty software
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and GIGO – garbage in, garbage out.
 The quality of software is not any better than the quality of the crap
 that the LLM itself generates, for say, human language/text.
 And how high quality is that? Well, that's an interesting question.
 My knee–jerk response is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The LLM's generate mostly trash.
 They can be useful as information–search machines, provided that you have
 some inate sense for how trust–worthy the answers are.
 Are the LLM's going to replace novelists? Not any time soon, but that also
 depends on your taste in literature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Can I put my finger on it? George Elliot is writing something that ...
 contains some deeper observation of humankind.
 Can an LLM emulate George Elliot in writing style? I suppose.
 Would it be pleasant to read? For a little while.
 Maybe.
 Depends on what you want.
 Many of us want human connection.
 Many others want to be distracted by baubles and trinkets.
 The LLM's seem to be bauble–and–trinket machines.
 I am looking for connection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But what is this connection thing? It seems vague, ineffable.
 I don't know how to describe it, at least, not yet.
 Perhaps there are brilliant young novelists who are working on this now.
 Perhaps for every brilliant novelist, there are 100 others, distracted
 and deluded by the hall of mirrors that are LLM's.
 And perhaps this is the great danger of LLM's: we have entered a hall of
 mirrors, and its showing us reflections of ourselves, reflections of others,
 but they are not what they seem, and we are mislead, and we smash into
 mirrors, just as we think we are walking forwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Are LLM's creating ideational pollution? Yes, they are.
 Are they useful? That too.
 Is the ideational pollution ...
 bad? Of course its bad, but how harmful is it? Can we quantify the harm?
 If LLM's are just photographs of language, well, are photographs harmful?
 Depends on the subject–matter of the photograph.
 But I fear the LLM trained to write in the style of famous author X, because
 that ...
 captures the surface, not the soul.
 Like a photograph captures the surface, not the soul.
 No one thinks a marble statue is alive, at least not any more.
 There are vague rumours that perhaps some idiots back in Ancient Greece
 might have feared marble statues.
 Is this even true? I don't know.
 But no one looks at a photograph, and thinks what is there is alive.
 They might imbue a living quality to the subject matter of the photograph:
 imagining the subject to have once been real, to have once been alive,
 to imagine the breathing soul that was once there, when the photo was taken.
 But the boundary between photo and life is clear an obvious.
 The boundary between an LLM imitating famous author X, and the actual famous
 author X, that boundary is very hard to see.
 Did author X imbue a deep soul into their writing? Well, yes, they very
 much attempted to do so.
 But in the end, author X created a pile of dead words, a verbal simulacrum
 of what is alive.
 So that stuff that the LLM is creating, does it have less of a soul than
 what author X created? Well, probably yes, because by definition, it is
 a simulacrum of a simulacrum.
 And there is always loss of fidelity when making copies.
 But is this loss of fidelity observable to anyone who is not a literary
 snob? An audiophile? Yes, I am one of the people who can hear low–quality
 audio, and tell it apart from high–quality audio.
 But I am also willing to accept low–quality audio almost all the time.
 I am almost never annoyed by it.
 I rarely go the extra mile to get higher–quality stuff.
 Well, I did spend a lot of time selecting headphones...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So is the simulacrum that is offered by LLM's ...
 acceptable? I guess it all depends.
 If I use an LLM personally as a tool, not a problem.
 If I have to endure junk phone calls powered by LLMs, then I fucking hate
 them.
 Of course.
 But then there's all that stuff in the middle: an ocean of weak–minded
 individuals spewing weak–minded drivel, and can you enjoy their social
 companionship? Perhaps.
 Can you do something more than that with them? Maybe, if they are construction
 workers.
 Creatives.
 Do you want to stare at a bunch of mediocre–quality creative content? I
 dunno.
 Do you want to eat a bunch of mediocre–tasting food? Sometimes its OK,
 and sometimes its not what your soul wants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Am I hand–wringing about what the future will bring? Yes, I am.
 Should I get of my ass and get to work? Yes, I probably should.
 Or rather, this is the normal human response to this situation: get off
 your ass, never mind the torpedoes, full speed ahead.
 While others cower.
 But it can be put a different way: one can get bored worrying, and so the
 call to action is more about a rejection of hand–wringing, because the
 hand–wringing simply got boring.
 This is the knife–edge of human decision making: what will I do next? Will
 I write one more sentence in this diary, or while I continue reading the
 Anthropic website? I am leaving so many unfinished thoughts on the table.
 But finishing those thoughts seems like a waste of time.
 What a fucking conundrum.
 Should I auto–pilot, gut–feel my way through life? Should I be thoughtful?
 How can I know the difference? How do I exert a difference? Fuck me, this
 is hopeless, but I am not going to be despondent, and so ...
 I guess I've verbally exhausted myself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Heh.
 Like running a marathon.
 When do you stop? When your exhausted, or do you take one step more? Only
 illness and ill health will stop the true marathoner, and even then, there
 are those who push past the pain.
 And, as a rower, I know what it means to push past the pain.
 So I can do that, I can endure, if that is what I set myself to do.
 What a fucked up analogy: I'm going to write words, endure, push out one
 more string of text, even though it is boring to do so? WTF? What's the
 right analogy here? Is it like hyperventilating, until one is dizzy? I
 think I did that just now.
 I think I'm dizzy now.
 I think I better stop hyper–venti–writing.

\begin_layout Standard
So I'm reading the Claude docs, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 are the thing that gets my interest up the most.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ohh...
 here's an interesting one: the prompt–improver example.
 It includes:

List the key concepts from the sentence

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags.
 Include the following: - List of key concepts from the sentence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 – Now this is where LLM rubber can hit GOFAI road.
 I can use concepts as single-word keys into an ontology, and associate
 those single–word signifiers to blobs of text, and then use Claude to judge
 similarity between blobs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is my file–system similarity project: I've got a pile of file–system
 data, and I want to find similar directories by similar content.
 Or better yet, identical directories, and, in the end, identify corrupted
 content.
 So how would this work today, vs.
 in the future?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Today, I would have to feed structured data into Claude, pay $dd.cc / mega-token,
 write a detailed prompt to get it to judge similarity.
 Now, I've already hand–written code to do this...
 but now the idea of performing similarity compares is handed over to Claude.
 And I already know from prior experience that the detailed form of the
 similarity metric doesn't much matter.
 If it were to matter, that can be deferred to some future day, where maybe
 I could ask Claude to use some more precise form of similarity.
 What else do I need? A user interface.
 Can I ask Claude to write that user interface for me? I guess I could try.
 This could be a worthy experiment.
 It's a task that is just concrete enough that maybe it can be done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a far cry from what I want in the long run: I want an assistant.
 One I could direct with a minimum of prompting to perform this task.
 But I'm not there yet.
 Well, I also want to create this assistant.
 And ...
 well, how to start?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The meta–problem seems to be that writing prompts that get Claude to perform
 some specific technical task appears to be just about as hard as writing
 the software myself.
 I don't see how to use Claude to save myself time.
 Perhaps in some shallow ways.
 Maybe like asking questions on stackexchange.
 Or rather, finding answers on stackexchange: whenever I ask questions,
 the responses I get are stunningly underwhelming.
 I think I understand why: my questions are too vague, too unfocused, overbroad,
 or deeper, beyond the depth and experience of the pool of people answering
 those questions.
 So I get terrible replies.
 Or no replies, to be more precise.
 A failure for my personal use.
 But if I have some error message ..
 wow, stack exchange provides wonderful clues if not answers.
 So, yes a generic chatbot seems great.
 But ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm still stumped.
 I'm still reading Claude docs.
 All the examples are in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pretend you're a lawyer, a CEO, Sherlock Holmes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 class.
 And ...
 none of my thinking ever requires these kinds of talents.
 I understand that parts of the economic sphere do require this.
 I am far enough away from those spheres that I am confused about the actual
 utility.
 Clearly, LLM's are very useful for students cheating on exams.
 Hmm.
 I get it but I don't get it.
 I guess I can stick to my mental image of LLM's as being photorealistic
 snapshots of language, and as long as you ask 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how would Sherlock Holmes respond to this?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 then you will get a good imitation of that.
 And since lawyers and CEO's are wordcels, I guess they can be easily imitated.
 Insofar as this diary is a wordy brain–dump of a shape–rotator, I fear
 (or rather, I already know, because I tried with Claude) it will get my
 writing style and verbal personality down just fine, but my underlying
 thought process remains opaque to Claude.
 But ..
 for how long? Five years? Longer?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
14 March 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Heh.
 I really want to write about hierarchical similarity measures.
 For over a week.
 But first, yet another distraction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
High–dimensional space, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{d}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 a million or a billion, with interest in 
\begin_inset Formula $d\to\infty$
\end_inset

.
 This is a Cartesian product, and NOT assumed to be Euclidean.
 So, a disjoint product.
 Lots of informal discussions fall into the trap of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{d}$
\end_inset

 being Euclidean.
 I want to keep in mind that it could be e.g.
 a fiber bundle, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $d=b+f$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is the dimension of the base space, and 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is the dimension of the fiber, giving the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trivial
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 fiber bundle 
\begin_inset Formula $B\times F$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\dim B=b$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\dim F=f$
\end_inset

 and so locally isomorphic to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{b}\times\mathbb{R}^{f}$
\end_inset

.
 The point here being that dynamics on a fiber bundle is very different
 than dynamics on a Euclidean space of the same (product) dimension.
 This is, of course, obvious from conventional physics/math.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The part that I'm struggling with is not that, but rather the case where
 
\begin_inset Formula $d=d_{1}+\cdots+d_{k}$
\end_inset

 where each subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}$
\end_inset

 is locally Euclidean, and where the different subspaces 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{i}\simeq\mathbb{R}^{d_{i}}$
\end_inset

 are related to one–another as fibers.
 There are several cases to ponder.
 One is the level–fiber case: declare that 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{1}$
\end_inset

 is the base space, and all other 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{j}$
\end_inset

 are fibers on top of 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 This is the default for particle physics: the base space is Minkowski spacetime
, and the various fibers on top are electroweak and color.
 Also spin can the thought of as a funky fiber.
 As can vierbeins.
 The various 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}$
\end_inset

 are fixed; this is just the standard model 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$
\end_inset

, nothing more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More confusing is the case of hierarchical arrangements: some 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{j}$
\end_inset

 are fibers on top of other 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{i}$
\end_inset

 ...
 thus, the relationship of fibers to bases is as a tree: the base–space
 
\begin_inset Formula $B=E_{1}$
\end_inset

 being the root of the tree.
 Now that we have switched our viewpoint to a graphical representation of
 the relationships between bases and fibers, we may consider more types
 of graphs: the DAG, so that there are multiple paths to a subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{i}$
\end_inset

 and also graphs without a base, i.e.
 having cycles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am not aware of any discussions in math or physics that allows for such
 hierarchical arrangements.
 The closest is perhaps the discussion of algebras of Grassmanians and tensor
 algebras, but these have a very regular structure, whereas I'm talking
 about blocks of subspaces (and no anti–symmetry.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Last but not least is having the decomposition into 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 pieces vary from patch to patch (patch, in the sense of coordinate patch
 from an atlas, as conventionally defined for a manifold.) Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 might vary from patch to patch, as might each 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 This is a bit ...
 crazier, so I will tiptoe and muddle.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So anyway, the conventional structure of a fiber bundle includes the creation
 of a connection, and the decomposition of that connection into vertical
 and horizontal pieces.
 With appropriate consistency conditions applied to each piece, as required
 by projections down to the base space, and by symmetries on each fiber.
 The proposal above is, I guess, that such relationships should be applied
 along each edge of the relational graph.
 That is, draw a graph, with directed edges, and then ask that each edge
 represent a fiber product, with one vertex standing for the base space,
 and the other the fiber space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What would be the point of this? Well, the thoughts above were inspired
 by reading something about neural–net transformers and attention heads.
 And I'm imagining that local regions correspond to grains in some lattice.
 Or perhaps even appropriate for some other physics thoughts I've had.
 But doing the work is hard, and progress would be slow.
 So ...
 its not obvious that this idea should be pursued.
 Like all ideas I write here: its shallow, and making progress would be
 hard.
 Later.

\begin_layout Standard
So I'm thinking about deep-learning neural nets as dynamical systems, and
 they have this property of clustering together similar things, and suddenly
 it pops into my head ..
 wait, that's what gravitation does.
 It pulls things together.
 Clusters stuff.
 Well, so does E&M.
 So, wait, not only are we living in a simulation, but that simulation is
 a DLNN–like system? Oof.
 Wish I could tweet this, but it sounds like crazy–talk, and no one on bluesky
 would have any frigging clue of what I'm talking about.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BTW, in my responsibility to myself in keeping a journal, I'm on bluesky
 now.
 Which is ..
 meh.
 The bluesky algos keep pushing furry porn at me.
 I used to spend hours a day on twitter blocking actual nazis.
 Now on bsky I'm spending hours a day blocking furries.
 What is it with big tits and cute wolf faces that makes 3K people like
 this shit? Unfulfilled sexual fantasies, I guess? Whatever.
 Having to mute/block because of insane algos sucks.
 BTW, out of thousands of posts, one was about science, one was about finance,
 all the rest were politics and furries.
 Not a good start, there bsky.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK.
 Enough.
 Back to DLNN dynamical systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My attention span is that of a gnat.
 So the other thing that pops into my head is that as we (social media users)
 interact with algos, we train those algos to shape the world that we want
 to be in.
 But this is a many–body mean–field system, and those algos are shaping
 us.
 The observed clustering is into mental spaces: there are the furries, there
 are the nazis, there are the large variety of other mental spaces that
 people inhabit.
 All the work in psychology showing training, learning, etc.
 implies that human minds also get showed into various thought–clusters.
 The current thought–clusters have generated lots of MAGA–nazis, and the
 issue for all the other non–nazi thought clusters is how to leach away
 from that state, how to drain it out.
 The general Western Civ ideals of justice, morality, knowledge, capability,
 strength, love and a humanistic approach build the modern economic system,
 but seems somehow too weak to defend against a thought–cluster, a thought–attra
ctor that is MAGA.
 I guess the biological analog is that MAGA is a cancer.
 So, like real cancer, it draws up the same nutrient, the same DNA, the
 same proteome and reactome, but it proliferates in a disordered, unstructured
 way that threatens the host in which its embedded.
 Thought leaders like Elon Musk are like ...
 I dunno, hormones that promote cancer.
 In short, Western Civ, or at least, the USA, has an acute case of brain
 cancer.
 What can be done to kill it? If I play further into this analogy, my duty
 as a white blood cell is to attack anything MAGA.
 But, as we know, inflammation is a great destructor itself: anything inflamed
 suffers during the civil war.
 Ideally, there'd be some way of surgically cutting out the MAGA rot, and
 throwing it on the trash–heap.
 But we've got no surgical instruments for this mind–rot.
 But we do have algorithms.
 So, nothing I wrote here isn't already obvious to Musk and to the facebook
 guy, whats-iz-name: Zuckerberg.
 They presumably understand the power of the algo.
 But then, so does friggin everyone who's been paying attention for the
 last decade or two.
 So my hand–wringing in this paragraph is, again, hand–wringing.
 What's the point? I write down the obvious.
 Well, politically obvious.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mathematically, scientifically, we have no general understanding of how
 cancer actually works, either the medical kind, or the brain–rot delusional
 kind.
 We know that algos can make things better or worse.
 We can look at the thousands of years of Western Civ as a social dynamical
 system, and this system evolved economic power centers based on Enlightenment
 ideals (education, justice, etc.) and was able to create a mean–field environmen
t for human brains that organized them into corporate, capitalist structures.
 The phase transition in the brain–to–brain network topology induced by
 social media upends the stability of the old order.
 Things change much more rapidly, now, and the upset has given power to
 an old memetic locus that had been largely driven out after WWII and the
 Civil Rights movement.
 viz.
 the nazi way of thought.
 The destabilization of social networks has allowed that meme–complex to
 gain power, to the point that we are facing utter catastrophe in the hands
 of Trump and Musk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only insight here is that although it is the topological re–arrangement
 of social media that has allowed this old toxic thought–form to re–emerge,
 we can't go back to how things were, before the deluge.
 The new system entangles algos and human brains.
 It's going to follow whatever dynamics it follows.
 Eventually, I believe that sanity will prevail.
 Because I'm an optimist.
 That there will be great damage along the way appears to be unavoidable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The damage is more ...
 metaphysical, at least for now.
 No one is dropping bombs on American cities.
 At least not yet, and hopefully never.
 So we won't have the smoldering ruins that was Europe after WWII.
 But those were physical ruins.
 Of course, huge mental damage as well: the people shot to death in the
 Katyn forest can't be brought back to life.
 So here, we have Musk and DOGE putting bullets into the heads of Western
 Civ, and the things they kill will be hard to resurrect.
 But this analogy is poor.
 A physical bullet into a physical brain really does kill.
 A physical bullet into (what's the right analogy, here?) a tank of jellyfish?
 a tree–root, a blob of mold? it grows back, sort–of, but wounded and deformed.
 The damage to the Dept of Education, the Dept of Energy, the DOJ is huge.
 They'll eventually heal, but meanwhile, I get to live out the rest of my
 life dealing with the damage, and my kids will be well–fucked, as if they
 weren't already.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And that's the problem: we were well–fucked over entering into this state.
 Will Trump succeed in destroying America? Maybe, maybe not.
 I hope not.
 We're at a critical juncture, now.
 Well, maybe we're always at a critical juncture.
 See? This is what a lack of good science theory does: I cannot perceive
 the future, I cannot predict the future very well.
 Things do seem precarious.
 Dangerous.
 On the verge of a great national disaster.
 But ...
 how am I responding to this? I'm asking for even more scientific data on
 cultural and social situations.
 Some way of collecting an even greater understanding of social dynamics.
 Some even bigger algo: the ring to rule them all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This may strike some as being even worse.
 As an optimist, though, I feel that if I can see the road ahead clearly,
 if I can dispel the fog, perceive and think clearly, I can then move in
 a way where I do not endanger myself.
 As it happens, only algos and compute power give me that ability.
 Me meaning we.
 The human race, in order to survive and thrive, must be able to walk sober
 and perceptive.
 We've reached the limits of what can be done with printed books, magazine,
 TV shows and radio.
 The algos have much, much greater power than TV and print media ever did.
 So, oe could say: the algos got us into this mess.
 It can get us out.
 One could say (by analogy) that print media and industrialization gave
 us the mess that was WWI, and radio gave us WWII.
 The algos are giving us the mess that is Trump.
 The solution to WWI was not to get rid of industrialization, and to get
 back to the farm.
 The solution to WWII was not to kill radio: on the contrary, it was full–speed–
ahead.
 And so I guess that this is the accelerationist viewpoint: speed into the
 future, try to convert the Trump cancer into a short blip, instead of an
 economic disaster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But can it work? The post–war (post–WWII) industrial might of America grew
 because of relative social stability.
 Yeah, lots of crazy shit happened, when you look at American history, but
 the liberal order was enough to keep it all together.
 The Deep State functioned.
 The FBI arrested criminals and threw them in jail, and all that.
 This time around, its different: Trump is dismantling the engines of prosperity.
 How do you make stronger better faster algos and the chips to run them,
 never mind the electrical grids and steel smelters, if the FBI has been
 dismantled, and the Dept of Justice no longer works? I mean, sure, Nazi
 Germany managed to keep an industrial system going.
 Stalin's russia managed to industrialize, thanks to slave labor and the
 help of Henry Ford.
 Ordinary people living in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia hated it, there.
 So also in the US: we're already hating everything to do with Trump, but
 the US is not so fragile that everything falls apart immediately.
 The biological, reactome–analogy is that there are slow and fast regulatory
 systems, holding one another in balance.
 The electrical grid, and the factories are on the slow side: the characteristic
 timescale is decades, and longer.
 The destruction of the DOJ is short time–scale.
 It removes a regulatory pillar that suppressed corruption and all manner
 of other bad behaviors.
 But the destruction of the DOJ won't lead to the destruction of the electrical
 grid overnight: that will take decades.
 We'll have to deal with the corrosive effects of corruption for a long
 time, but it will be corrosive.
 But this is, again, the multi–decade time scale.
 The upscaling of algos is ...
 well, its also err..
 shorter than decades.
 The time–scale of algos is I guess about five years.
 Time for the software to be developed, the theory to be worked out.
 Integrated into the social fabric.
 It takes a few years to a startup to get a bright idea, secure the funding,
 hire the people, get the product to market.
 So, a five year time–scale.
 The destruction of the DOJ does not immediately hurt this cycle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What about the DJIA and NASDAQ? If Trump & Musk send those into a tailspin,
 economic activity will slow.
 Which will slow the work on the algos.
 I.E it makes things much harder for the accelerationists.
 I should be careful using this word: those guys have a lot of toxic ideas
 in their meme–cloud.
 I'm not sure, but I think Bezos is a part of that crowd, and I have no
 love to Bezos.
 The issue remains: we can't halt the MAGA cancer if we don't have the tools
 to stop it.
 Hoping that algos will do the trick is ...
 back in the 5–10–20 year time–scale.
 The Trump destruction is now measured in weeks and days.
 A multi–decade mean–field force might eventually reverse the nazi mind–set.
 Eventually.
 But the shit is happening so fast that, well, it won't provide the answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK.
 I am done here.
 Blathering on like this ...

 It clarifies something in my mind.

 I like it 100% better than anything else I've read on the topic.
 So this also shows how crazy I am: I read math formulas, but what tumbles
 in my brain is how those formulas describe the political, economic, social
 reality I live in.
 Well, maybe this is not so weird.
 I suppose all the techies are thinking this way, these days.
 Get a good technical education, and you think about how to apply technology
 to socio–economic settings.
 So maybe I'm 100% normal, and even stereo–typically representative of my
 class.
 Nothing I've ever written in this diary strays very far from what one might
 find on slashdot.
 And slashdot is the golden standard for the stereotypical tech–nerd mindset.
 I feel like such a loser.
 Incapable even of original thinking.
 Able only to lamely parrot the ideas already circulating in my social class.
 Not a single original thought in my head.
 Well, I'm joking.
 Half–joking? I think I have many original ideas.

I wrote the below in response to a blog post: https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As to Yarvin and his ideas: I want to sketch some background about present–day
 political philosophy.
 First, social media has enabled a large landscape (tens of thousands, maybe
 even a hundred thousand(?) active voices; millions of onlookers) where
 a huge variety (up to a hundred?) of political theories have been discussed.
 Yarvin's ideas have been torn to shreds in many of these.
 I cannot recap, but "Culture Wars 2.0" is a sketch of how things stood about
 seven years ago: Peter N.
 Limberg and Conor Barnes [The Memetic Tribes Of Culture War 2.0](https://medium.c

\begin_layout Standard
I nominally tracked the so–called "Plan B" group.
 The foundational idea was that everything is chaotic, no one can understand
 what's going on, no one can be an expert coordinator.
 Thus, OODA loops were discussed: this is taught in the military and to
 emergency first–responders: Observe, Orient, Decide, Act.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, most of the people in the discussion had little or no education in
 sociology or psychology or political theory, so a lot of time was spent
 on general education.
 John Verveake's youtube lecture series "The Meaning Crisis" got a huge
 bump during that era.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the novel ideas was "delegative voting": if no one is an expert on
 every issue, then one should be allowed to delegate one's vote to the person
 who you think would be the expert.
 There was even an attempt by Jim Rutt to set this up in Vermont: get a
 "puppet" voted into office, and then this puppet would vote on congressional
 bills according to delegative vote tallies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a political movement, the Plan B people didn't have enough of clear–cut
 platform or statement or proposal or fix that could propel it forward;
 just hand–wringing about post–capitalism and meta–modernism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the accelerationists did split off from this group: if everything
 is too complex for any one person to understand, then maybe we can use
 systems modeling and systems dynamics software (Jim Rutt was from the Center
 of Complexity and Dynamical Systems Research in Santa Fe) and so build
 the AI–to–rule–them–all.
 Create a (software) world–model that is able to perceive all possible social
 and economic states, perform the system dynamics modeling, and chart out
 a path that takes society from the sordid mess it is in today, to a wonderful
 future where the system dynamics modeler perceives and provides Pareto-optimal
 solutions, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was called "accelerationist" because obviously, today's LLM's, DL-NN's,
 chat-gpts and system modellers cannot do this, yet.
 But maybe if we hurry up and go faster ...
 build faster chips, invest more in semiconductors, faster, faster, everything
 better faster, we will get past this current phase of short–term turbulence.
 Wonderful idea, eh? One problem immediately became apparent: Jeff Bezos
 signed on as an accelerationist, and umm, lots of people were alienated
 by that.
 Musk did NOT sign on, but clearly he thinks that way.
 Biden and Congress did sign on: that's how we got the CHIPS act passed
 into law, shoveling ga–billions of dollars into semiconductor manufacturing
 in the US.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FWIW, I do believe that better systems modeling is the only way forward.
 Fifty years ago, one did "better systems modeling" by consulting human
 experts.
 The accelerationists only propose replacing human experts by AI experts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The political problem is that Trump and everyone around him is explicitly
 hostile to experts in any shape or form.
 They're actively destroying government.
 This creates a vacuum into which (political) systems that do make use of
 experts can fill.
 And who uses experts, these days? Well, corporations! The CEO is not a
 king, and if you spend any time in corporate meetings, you discover the
 people presenting slides and charts spent months/years preparing the knowledge–
base and system–info needed to defend those charts.
 I have never met a stupid executive.
 Wacky, maybe, but always super–ultra–sharp.
 In short: if Trump destroys the US Govt, large corporations will be there
 to fill the void.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is, to be clear, the libertarian dream.
 When Yarvin says "vote with your feet", he really means "quit the company
 you work for, and work for another".
 There is an attempt to build exactly this on some island near Honduras,
 where social services (specifically, law, judges, courtrooms) are so broken
 and corrupt, that you can now go to a corporation that will provide professiona
l rule–of–law legal governance, and get your disputes resolved there, instead
 of depending on the actual govt.
 (Prospera Consortium).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where else do we have experts? Well, ...
 Universities.
 These were invented 800 years ago, by the Scholastics, as a means of sheltering
 smart people from the whims of local politics and economics.
 Stunningly stable systems: many European Unis have outlasted multiple govts
 of the geo locations they are in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Universities were originally designed to provide governance and social services
 to smart people.
 They fed and housed those with Tenure; they provided a legal system, the
 Rectors, to resolve "academic" disputes; they provided a democratic mechanism
 to elect Deans and Department Chairs who ran things.
 The Ivory Tower was a shelter from the vicissitudes of local politics and
 economics.
 Teaching students was only a side–gig, to bring in money.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Somehow, the side–gig ate the system.
 Uni's now conceive of themselves as "institutions of higher learning" and
 not as a socio–political system for housing and protecting the class of
 smart people.
 In this sense, they lost their way.
 Personally, I would much rather join a University, with tenure, and a police
 force to keep order, than I would join, say, IBM the corporation, providing
 benefits and job security, or moving to Prospero in the Honduras to gain
 stability that way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the smart people at Universities seem to have lost the plot.
 Too busy publishing papers.
 Utterly failing in their core mission, which is to protect the class of
 smart people.
 And this is how we get Yarvin.

 argued to be 4 or 5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The power–law distribution of avalanche sizes would

, but the exponents 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

could differ
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from lower–dimensional cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The avalanche size exponent 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 would approach 3/2, as opposed to approximately 1 in 2D.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The directed abelian sandpile model is exactly solved in all dimensions,
 and has dimension–dependent exponents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The avalanche dynamics simplify, due to vast connectivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hedging basically says that high dimensions have not really been studied
 and that its numerically difficult.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Follow–up question: Has the sandpile model been studied on high–dimensional
 hypercubes? Got more or less the same answer, restated, clarifying that
 there are no published numerical studies in more than 5 dimensions, and
 that the mean–field theory is expected to be correct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Asked about my Zipf exponent being -1/2.
 It says that the cumulative exponent is -3/2 and this is typical of mean–field

\begin_layout Itemize
In random networks—such as Erdős–Rényi random graphs or scale–free networks
 near a critical point—dynamics like percolation, cascading failures, or
 self–organized criticality (SOC) can lead to power–law distributions.
 A key mechanism is the branching process, which approximates the spreading
 of activity (e.g., node activation, edge failures, or avalanches) in highly
 connected or high–dimensional systems.
 In a branching process, each "event" (e.g., a node toppling) triggers a random
 number of subsequent events, with an average branching ratio R.
 At criticality R=1, the size distribution of cascades or avalanches follows
 a power law with an exponent of -3/2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For a Galton-Watson branching process at criticality, the probability of
 a cascade of size 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $P(s)\sim s^{-3/2}e^{-s/s_{c}}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{c}$
\end_inset

 is a cutoff scale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This is the hallmark of mean–field criticality, where spatial correlations
 are negligible due to the randomness or high connectivity of the network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Erdős–Rényi Graphs: At the percolation threshold (average degree 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle k\right\rangle =1$
\end_inset

, the size distribution of connected components follows 
\begin_inset Formula $P(s)\sim s^{-3/2}$
\end_inset

 in the critical regime, reflecting a mean–field branching process.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Scale-Free Networks: In models with a degree distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $P(k)\sim k^{-\gamma}$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $2<\gamma<3$
\end_inset

), cascading failures or spreading processes (e.g., epidemic models) can yield
 
\begin_inset Formula $P(s)\sim s^{-3/2}$
\end_inset

 when tuned to criticality, as the high–degree hubs enhance connectivity,
 mimicking mean–field conditions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
SOC on Networks: Sandpile–like models on random graphs (e.g.
 each node topples to a random subset of neighbors) often produce 
\begin_inset Formula $P(s)\sim s^{-3/2}$

 , as the randomness disrupts spatial constraints, aligning with mean–field
 SOC predictions.

A week ago, I noted that Grok assured me that it would remember our conversation.
 Well, apparently, it lied.
 Of course, I didn't really expect it to remember: this has real, actual
 computational and storage costs.
 Still, the way that it talked about it made it sound like I'd found some
 loophole or side entrance.
 Reassuring, I guess, that I didn't ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or did I? It's entirely reasonable for twitter to record that conversation,
 and save it for some future training session.
 I assume their terms of service give them the right to do this.
 Saving the conversation is easy.
 Training on it is easy.
 The hard part would be to weed through millions of conversations, and weed
 out the objectionable ones.
 Any conversations that could 'pollute' it's mind–space.
 Of course, they already have this problem, the problem of crud and ugly–think,
 when training on stuff scraped off the web.

So, it is reasonable to conclude that perhaps some future version of Grok

FWIW, here's the prompt (I'm going to pollute my own knowledge–space by

 Grok doesn't know my name! Odd, I thought it would have access to my twitter

 It just told me that it doesn't have access for privacy reasons.
 Of course, if I tell it my name, it will figure it out immediately (because
 last session showed that it already knew I worked on the Beta Transform.
 Possibly because it screen–scraped all of arXiv.) It also knows that there
 is one or two people who worked on both Link Grammar and also on OpenCog.
 With a bit more prompting, I suppose I could get it to connect the dots.
 But that's a boring game, for now.

\begin_layout Standard
Whoa.
 Can't wait to get to there.
 This is wildly counter–intuitive, for many reasons.
 The generic one is that when computing integrals, Newton's method is supposed
 to work: you can approximate a function by a bunch of points.
 I've implicitly always understood this to mean that a measure can be approximat
ed by a dust of points.
 How can this not be so? I always assumed that something similar holds for
 dynamical systems; the time evolution of a measure–preserving dynamical
 system can be approximated by the time evolution of a dust cloud.
 I'm flabbergasted.
 Well, Section 9.1 is in the future.

A Wasserstein gradient flow proxy.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 where they notice that constraining dynamics to the surface of a sphere
 causes unwanted issues.
 My knee-jerk reaction is that this shows that constraint was flawed, and
 that they should be working in projective space, instead.
 That is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}$
\end_inset

 ...
 woof.
 But we don't want that either, because projective space identifies +1 and
 -1.
 So maybe instead, just work in Euclidean space, and treat the normalization
 as a gauge condition or Lagrange multiplier? Alternately, treat each ray
 from the origin as a fiber, treat the whole thing as a fiber bundle, a
 line bundle, glue up the atlas for the fibers so its a sphere? That way,
 the dynamical equations can wander off and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

denormalize
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but since the values are always on a ray, one can always project back
 down, in the end, and constrain the finale result to a sphere, if that
 is your heart's desire.
 The people writing this paper have never heard of fiber bundles, it seems.
 Why else wouldn't they do it this way?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Somewhat more remarkable is the general feeling that much of the treatment
 in section 3 should already be well–developed and present in some or another
 treatment of homogeneous spaces or something like that, already worked
 out in some generic Lie algebra setting.
 The model seems both basic, and yet the treatment, while mostly pretty
 good, gets pointlessly muddled by this sphere constraint.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I mean, I could figure this out if I spent a day or a week or a month fiddling

Page 14, Remark 3.8 (Particle version) talks about the particle version.
 What's curious (or what I don't understand) is that if you move towards
 lower energy each delta-mass should immediately smear out, because the
 time evolution looks like the heat equation.
 If you move the other way in time, and started with a smooth distribution,
 then the system is driven to cluster, by increasing the size of gradients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, we seem to be studying the heat equation on a high–dimensional
 sphere.
 The heat equation running in reverse.
 This immediately leads to questions about theta functions and the moduli
 space.
 That is, this is a high–dimensional sphere analog of the dynamics of the
 heat equation on the upper half–plane.
 All sorts of concepts should carry over...
 so, once again, string theory.

Next sentence: 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The modern approach to generative modelling consists in picking a simple
 base distribution...
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and they describe a sphere.
 Building a random distribution (i.i.d.) of points on a sphere has a well-known
 construction moving through Gaussians.
 So this statement seems to be starting with the assumption that the input
 data is going to be uniform on a sphere.
 This is a hot take.
 Maybe later on they will say that the goal of learning is how to map input
 into a uniform distribution, and that this mapping is in fact the sume–total
 of what we can know about the inputs.
 That's an interesting idea.
 Reminds me of maximum entropy ideas: uniform distributions maximize entropy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, writing about anything is a double–edged sword.
 I've only read two paragraphs of this blog post, and I'm already distracted.
 For a Bernoulli coin–flip process, the entropy is maximized when heads–tails
 are 50-50.
 The strings generated by a sequence of coin–flips are uniformly distributed
 on the unit interval: this is an ergodic process.
 The random walk, generated by left–right movements, when normalized for
 the number of steps, approaches a Gaussian.
 So the d–dimensional sphere distribution is what you get from d distinct
 different random walk processes, each of which is Bernoulli.
 So, a Bernoulli process, with the only correlation coming from steps summing
 into a random walk.
 And doing this in d different processes.
 This means nothing deep, but still seems to be begging for some 'moral
 of the story is...' conclusion.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This cause me to read footnote 2, which I'd previously just skimmed.
 So, OK, calling it the pushfoward is not showing off.
 This is actually the correct thing to say here.
 OMG.
 Well, I could have saved my embarrassment by not committing my faulty thoughts
 to text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So that's interesting.
 I've thought of myself as a master of pushforwards all these years, and
 here I am, looking at this and feeling surprised.
 I'm kind of stupid in that way.
 I get 98% percentile on my exams.
 Not 99%.
 That's how it works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I'm thinking about formula (1).
 I can maximize it by having 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 map everything to the origin.
 However, there is no map 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 that has such an inverse.
 And since 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 has to be defined for all of it's domain 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{d}$
\end_inset

, that means 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 has to be onto.
 Does it have to be one–to–one? Well, I don't see any argument for why it
 should be one–to–one.
 In fact, if the sample distribution has some very high–frequency variations
 in it, these could be aliased down to a multi–valued 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}$
\end_inset

.
 Aliasing here in the sense of the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem.
 That is, we don't really know if the sample distribution actually has this
 high–frequency structure, or if there's some other effect going on that
 caused 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 to fold over.
 Heck, they haven't stated whether 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 even needs to be continuous or not.
 I'm guessing that they assume it is, but none of this is clear to me just
 right now.
 Lets plow on.

So far I like my experiment with hot takes.
 It's forcing me to slow down, and to try to actually understand, instead

 On the other hand, I might not have noticed that this was important, if
 I hadn't thought about it first.
 Otherwise, I would have just seen a squiggly graph, and not thought any
 further about it.

Squiggly graph.
 So what.
 Big deal.
 Who cares.
 I've seen many squiggly graphs before.

At any rate, if 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is not one–to–one, then 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is multi–valued.
 And formula (1) does not use any notation that suggests that 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-1}$
\end_inset

 might be multi–valued.
 So maybe 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is both an injection and a surjection, that is, an isomorphism.
 OK.
 I guess I can hang with that.
 There's nothing wrong with that, I suppose.
 So figure one is illustrating how 
\begin_inset Formula $T\#p_{0}=p_{0}\circ T^{-1}$
\end_inset

 can be multi–valued, and not 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 itself.
 Whatever.

Still.
 I still don't get something.
 If I can't have 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 map everything to the origin, then maybe I can have 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 map almost everything to very near the origin? In that case, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 does the opposite: it maps a very small neighborhood of the origin to almost
 all of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{d}$
\end_inset

.
 And now the intuition is that this can best be done in a sensible way by
 having 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 be a linear map.
 So is 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 supposed to be linear? They didn't say that.
 Am I supposed to know that? Even if it is linear, one can maximize formula
 (1) by making 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 map everything into smaller and smaller regions of the origin.
 So making 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 linear solves nothing.
 There also has to be some constraint on 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 e.g.
 that it has a unit norm or something.
 Or is bounded away from zero in some way.
