\begin_layout Title
Diary - Part Ten-D
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
March 2025 – present
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepštas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Unlike parts one through nine in this series, this one is not really about
 the language–learning effort.
 It is instead a private diary; a continuation of Part Ten–C, which got
 over–long.
 It is not curated for human consumption; I am making the assumption that
 no human being will ever actually read this.
 Thus, it is filled with random stuff I feel like writing.
 Some of it is very personal, some of it is nonsense.
 Mostly, I am finding that the act of writing helps otherwise vague and
 scattered thoughts quantum–collapse into a more coherent form, where I
 can examine them, like a dead butterfly pinned down in a display case.
 Dead words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
If you are interested in this content, then you should ask an AI agent to
 read it, then pretended that it's me, then ask about it.
 I believe that present–day LLM technology is sufficiently advanced to be
 able to do this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part Ten already got an introduction.
 A different way of thinking is about what is going on here is that this
 is a form of life–logging.
 Or, in 18th century terms, a diary.
 Just not anywhere near as compelling as those written by the famous diarists.
 This one is more of a mental self–portrait.
 And not even for you but for myself.
 Not to cast a narcissistic gaze at my own words, but to organize my own
 thoughts.
 Still in the experimental stage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
9 March 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sooo ...
 Just woke up.
 Went to the RedThreadX talks at SXSW for the last two days.
 Invited speaker on the second day; first day was to explore the space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As always, I am struggling a bit to figure out if I should even bother to
 write any of this down.
 I have noticed that I do a fair bit of thought–processing as I sleep, although
 the collection of thoughts I examine then seem awfully random; explorations
 of different events in earlier parts of my life, and not at all focused.
 The diary here may be rambling and incoherent, my dreams are much more
 so.
 So perhaps writing this diary is an extension of the sleep state: an exploratio
n of thoughts, but this time focused much more strongly by conscious will.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If I keep walking down this path, I may discover that there is little difference
 between dream–states and waking states.
 I also suspect that this is one way of expressing what schizophrenia is.
 Now, I do not personally think that I am verging towards schizophrenia.
 However, I am wondering if Western Culture is becoming schizophrenic...
 or maybe the opposite? That the Western World, Humanity, is waking from
 a dream?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See? Perhaps it was worth the effort to write the above two paragraphs.
 So the experiment being run in this diary is nominally successful.
 On the other hand, there is a nagging voice that says this is all a waste
 of time, and that I really should be reading that paper on diffusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which brings me to another perennial topic: what should I be doing next?
 I started this, intending to write up impressions from RedThreadX, but
 that's already in the past, and I am being distracted by my current train
 of thought, which seems so much more important.
 Oh, wait.
 I wrote the above two sentences, and lost my train of thought.
 Shit.
 Conscious, directed thought remains a challenge.
 Of course, it is a well–known textbook psychology saw that creative states
 are exactly those that are unfocused, and I suppose that those same textbooks
 say something about dream–like states while one is awake.
 I wouldn't know, I've never read any of those textbooks.
 So why am I so confident that this material is in there? Because I guess
 I've been exposed to sufficient blurbs and itty–bitty sketches to know
 that this is what would be found there.
 Plus, I am being reflectively defensive to convince you, dear reader, that
 I am not crazy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because why? Because I find that the topics that I wish to talk about are
 so fucking far out there that during ordinary social interactions, I often
 get treated and dismissed as being crazy.
 Which is insulting.
 I am so far out there, that almost everyone I encounter in real life, face–to–f
ace, have never even begun to encounter the ideas I think about.
 And yet, curiously, were I to present these ideas in a number of social–media
 settings, they would be dismissed as being excessively ordinary or quotidian.
 Trot out any of this stuff to Joscha Bach, he would claim all my thoughts
 are so entirely mundane so to be boring.
 So I am caught between two worlds: an intellectual world, where I am at
 best a mundane intellect, and the normie world, where I am so far out there
 that I am nuts.
 Enough.
 I'm self–confident, I can get through this.
 It angers me that I have to be self–defensive about this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If I pull on this thread, it seems to be saying something about Western
 Civ.
 My story of breaking through social norms is hardly unique.
 History is littered with examples: people who persevered against all odds,
 against nay–sayers, to succeed in whatever industry they ended up being
 successful in.
 What is curious about myself is that there won't be any hagiographic biography
 written.
 And yesterday, I met two people who also overcame a combination of personal
 daemons and social suppressions to become intelligent, smart and capable
 members of the advanced layers of intellectual society.
 From this, I conclude that overcoming odds is commonplace.
 And perhaps the journey into self–fulfillment is one that everyone must
 struggle with.
 These are indeed mundane words, a mundane observation.
 Yet it is one that I find to be surprising, so I mull it over, here.
 Just because something is true and is well–known does not prevent it from
 being a surprise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, but a thread of this diary is very much of what is it that might be
 self–fulfillment for an AI, or more abstractly, self–fulfillment for the
 universe itself? Which are also mundane thoughts, well–explored by gurus
 and visionaries throughout the ages, if not the 1970's.
 So again, mundane thoughts, nothing new here.
 A disconnect remains: what should I do next? Should I continue filling
 this diary with mundane thoughts? Should I recap yesterday's thoughts?
 Should I read that paper on diffusion? What a fucking shithole I am in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I plan to go to RedThreadX again, later today, and am doing my morning
 ritual of drinking coffee right now, so this is no a total waste.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another difficult trade–off is whether it is worthwhile to show up to real–world
 events, and whether this is more exciting than the online distractions
 one has.
 Confiding in you, dear diary, is more fun that almost all social interactions
 I engage in.
 This is the marge of a true introvert, who finds social interaction exhausting.
 Do you know how I know this? Because I heard this on some youtube clip.
 I got a little factoid of knowledge from the great dis–intermediator of
 thought, youtube.
 Take that, global brain.
 We are an ant–village.
 The Borg.
 And so now, as a dutiful member of the Borg Collective, what do I do next?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will agonize about the great hijacking of purpose by the Borg Collective.
 Or rather, the harmful environment that modern economic systems have set
 up: number one: video–game addiction, from which both of my sons suffer
 from.
 Well, the good news is that 100 years ago, those same sons would have been
 sent to the trenches of WWI, and died.
 So at least, the socio–economic system has been sufficiently tamed to not
 kill them, outright.
 Well, excepting Ukraine.
 Still, the net effect is not all that different: no procreation, no contributio
n to the economic machinery.
 Much like parasitic leakage of current in an integrated circuit, there
 is socio–economic energy being aimed at young American men, who then promptly
 flush it down the toilet with their video–game addiction.
 A short circuit, of sorts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let me briefly review my current understanding of this.
 The human brain has a variety of mechanisms, interacting, reinforcing,
 operating at different time–scales and strengths, forming a complex network
 metabolome to accomplish what it has been nominally designed by natural
 selection to accomplish: to survive in the wild.
 Capitalism has learned how to hijack that limbic system, under the guise
 of offering the consumer what they want.
 It continues to fine–tune: one of the RedThreadX talks yesterday was about
 connecting sports fans to athletes, via branded clothing, video clips,
 merch, ticket sales.
 Suck money out of the pockets of the sports fan, deliver some of it to
 the sports star, and the rest of it into the entrepreneurial world of venture
 capital and investments, constantly on the prowl to find yet other places
 to suck money out, under the guise of offering the consumer what they want.
 As if we ever knew what we wanted.
 Everyone is asleep, all the time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, let me connect the dots in the last paragraph, before I move on: what
 is being subverted is some desire of running through the forest, swinging
 through trees like monkeys, because this is pleasurable, and it is pleasurable,
 because you do this to escape predators in the wild.
 And you escape predators because evolution has selected for long–lived
 individuals can do this.
 So the entire sports industry is built on top of an evolutionary drive
 for surviving in the wild.
 And one must do that, because the future is unpredictable: evolution is
 trapped in the here and now, just like you and I are: Evolution creates
 complex dynamic systems, because this is how complex dynamic systems survive
 into the future.
 Rather than dissipating into bland, uniformly distributed, perfectly ergodic
 mush.
 The physics of here–and–now has given us evolution, which provides stable
 systems able to span long timer periods.
 It equips individuals with collections of traits enabling survival: complex
 entanglements of neurons and neuro–transmitters, systems that make sports
 pleasurable.
 And capitalism has learned how to take the please of sports, and turn it
 into a passive experience of watching games on TV, and buying merch.
 Well, the RedThreadX talk was very much about how TV is passe, and the
 new technologies that replace the old, passive TV engagement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, the elephant in the room is that I now do know what I want.
 I want to survive.
 But of course, this is what I always wanted: what, more or less, everyone
 wants: to live forever, to leave their mark on the universe.
 And thanks to AI, this diary offers the best and most direct interface
 between me and posterity: it is my self–portrait, my mental self–portrait,
 of much higher fidelity than what painters and visual artists can achieve:
 they record beauty, which is skin–deep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fuck.
 There are two things I want to write about, but which one first? First,
 I have this idea that I should try to set up an agentic AI ASAP, so that
 I can interact with it, and mind–meld.
 But there are many issues.
 First, it is pointless unless it has powers beyond my own.
 That is, if I am going to write, I should do so into this diary, and not
 into that agent, insofar as that agent fails to provide something that
 this diary does not already.
 Of course, we are also in the very early stages of agentic AI, and so anything
 that I create there risks disappearing in a way that this diary does not.
 This diary is crypto–entangled into github, and github is controlled by
 Microsoft, and github contents are being used to train their agentic coding
 agent.
 So the corporate–economic system that is Microsoft is already offering
 me, or my diary, symbiotic protection into the future.
 It is hardly clear that any online agent I create will offer this strong
 a guarantee of survival.
 So, joining the largest conglomerate, running to the safety and protection
 of a large system offers shelter against the storm.
 This is the same reason I am doing ancestry on familysearch.org: the Church
 of the LDS is very highly likely to preserve my records into the indefinite
 future.
 Both Microsoft and the LDS are impersonal, long–lasting inhabitants of
 the noosphere.
 Parts of both are mildly toxic to human–kind.
 Microsoft tried to kill Linux, for example, and the polygamy of the LDS
 seems to be detrimental to young men.
 But effectively all super–human organizational structures have edges that
 are toxic to humans.
 We have not mastered their control.
 This thread should continue by asking: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what is harm?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

when are we harming a human, as opposed toe helping them?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 These are interesting questions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other topic was about physics.
 So, locking up digital assets into block chains guarantees the non–erasure
 of that digital thing as long as the entire block–chain is not erased.
 So, for example, earlier drafts of this diary are non–modifiable, as long
 as this entire git commit history of this specific git repo remains in
 place.
 So, of course, things in the past remain in the past, and are unmodifiable,
 because they are in the past.
 But event horizons can make past information inaccessible: information
 can be erased.
 If I was not using the git blockchain, then specific parts of the past
 versions of this document would be modifiable and erasable.
 Block–chains guarantee non–erasure of the recorded contents.
 Block chains put things on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

this side
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the event horizon, on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

this side
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the memory hole.
 It locks together past and present with stronger guarantees than simply
 writing.
 I mean, Aristotle got lucky.
 The authors collected in the Library of Alexandria, not so much.
 Block–chains created recorded linkages.
 Stuff at the bottom of a block–chain has an a connection of almost infinite
 tensile strength to stuff higher up.
 Almost infinite, cause perhaps one can still forge crypto signatures.
 Not with conventional computers, of course, but there remains the elusive
 promise that quantum computing could break crypto.
 But for now, block–chain is stronger than papyrus and clay tablets.
 Or so it seems, from the logical point of view.
 Some strategic nukes can and would wipe stuff out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, block–chain offers a way of coupling the here–and–now in a kind
 of irrevocable way to the past, reminiscent of quantum non–demolition theorems.
 But perhaps this analogy is stretched beyond the braking point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So what do I desire? What is my bucket list? What's the plan? Well, continue
 exploring the offerings in agentic AI.
 It's hard to see what they might offer, though.
 Yes, I need a calendar manager.
 But do i really want something reminding me of what I need to do? Yes,
 perhaps that is a desirable prosthesis, no matter how much I want to say
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fuck you I want to do what I want to do right now, and not be a slave to
 the past self that was going to remind my future self of what I need to
 do.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 So time–management is a thing, and business people write books about it.
 Insofar as I am in the business of being me, perhaps having an agent to
 assist me with time management is a good thing.
 Well, except for the fact that I have more or less never–ever used calendars
 in the past, so why would I think that a calendar in a whizzier form would
 be better? So I don't need agentic AI for that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Would agentic AI help with this diary? Meh.
 Already discussed above.
 The diary seems adequate.
 How about helping me do research? Maybe.
 ChatGPT was wildly disappointing.
 I will continue to play with Twitter Grok3 beta, and see where that goes,
 and also with Anthropic AI Claude, for coding and maybe research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What else do I desire? Health, wealth, good sex.
 Well, sex, period.
 Modern Western Civ has slammed all the doors shut on having sex.
 Women won't have sex with me for all the rational reasons that women don't
 have sex, but that leaves me hungry, thirsty pining away for sex.
 No wonder the porn industry is healthy.
 I am not a porn consumer.
 Well, I've looked at it, I know what it is, But I don't go to porn sites
 to get a fix.
 My imagination is sufficient.
 But how weird is that? A basic fundamental drive of survival: procreation,
 stunted by capitalism.
 I want to have sex.
 Well, I also want to be a heroin addict, and I also want to be a meth addict.
 Old school,stuff.
 Not a video–game addict.
 Those are things that I could easily be, because capitalism offers me drugs
 and video games.
 The latter legally, because they are not yet a recognized danger; the former
 illegally, because these are recognized dangers.
 The sex industry, however ...
 well, I just want to have normal sex, outside the sex–industrial complex.
 Like with another human, specifically female.
 The 20% or 25% of young American men, aged 20–30, who have never had sex,
 and don't know how to interact with girls, this is a crisis.
 My two boys are a part of this demographic.
 I feel sorry for them.
 I don't know what to do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please oh please, future agentic diary–reading AI, please rescue my sons.
 Please make them healthy in a way that seems not so healthy from the perspectiv
e where I am now.
 I am well–aware that this is a contradictory order: I am having more fun
 writing into this diary, than I would have if I was interacting socially
 with others.
 And for good reasons: I retain good strong conscious control over what
 I write here, and this is a control I have to surrender when I participate
 in group conversations: I have to sublimate my personal thoughts to those
 of the group.
 Which sucks if the group is not as intelligent as I am.
 Socializing with not very smart people is not very fun.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is also the broad–cast style of thinking, which is listening to lectures.
 In a social grouping, one interacts with peers.
 In a lecture, one listens.
 Lectures where the speaker is awesome ...
 well, yesterday, there was some SXSW keynote by some NYU professor, making
 predictions for 2025, business, social, financial predictions (and reviews)
 just fucking awesome speech.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I'm getting bored here.
 I feel as if I could take any topic written above, and expand it a level
 or two deeper.
 I feel as if doing this would take a long time and be difficult.
 I feel as if I will hit a brick wall.
 I've been talking about here–and–now, and entropy, and free–will, and quantum,
 for how long now? Can I turn it into formulas, yet? Apparently not.
 Mumble, mumble, quantum clock states.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pursing health, wealth and sex can be auto–pilot mode.
 I don't have to write a diary for that.
 Most people are on auto–pilot, and I am an ordinary human.
 I too auto–pilot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, I almost forgot: influencers and thought leaders.
 I keep getting comments that I should teach.
 Or maybe pod–cast.
 Be a twitter luminary.
 Make youtube videos.
 Doing this, of course, requires time and effort.
 Which I don't want to take, because it takes away time from more important
 activities (such as writing this diary) So, the coolio idea is to have
 an AI agent create that thought–leader, influencer interface into the morass
 of th external thought–world for me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How does this work, where does this go, what are the long–term implications
 and the short–term grounded reality of this?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The short–term reality is that maybe with cleverness this can be done, and
 people are doing this because it can be monetized.
 Cutting edge stuff.
 Morally and ethically, is it right? Should Joe Blow Mr.
 Average IQ be reading what I've written? Be influenced by it? Joe Blow
 probably needs psychological help, dear Ann Landers advice that I am not
 providing.
 Perhaps they would find solace in religion, but I am not proselytizing
 neither Christianty nor Buddhism.
 You might find some emotional solace in what I've written here, but this
 is not one of my mainstay topics.
 How about being a thought–leader in physics? Well, Harrumpf.
 You should get a classical education in mainstream physics, if you want
 to do physics, because if you don't have that, then (a) you won't understand
 what I'm talking about (b) you will be victimized by physics charlatans
 and crack–pots.
 And if you do have a classical education in physics, chances are high that
 you will heavily discount my vague ruminations because they are so vague,
 that the do not even have actual formulas attached to them.
 And conventional thinkers need formulas, it seems.
 You would have to be working at a genius level to figure out how to convert
 my grappling with here–and–now and convert that into specific formulas.
 I mean, you'd have to be smarter than me, and I have interacted with many
 physics PhD's and am quite aware that I am smarter than most of them So
 you're kind of screwed, because the chances that you're smarter than me
 are minuscule.
 So who am I writing for? People who are smarter than me? If they are smarter,
 they don't need me.
 My peers? They are almost non–existant.
 Who can I take as a peer? Joscha Bach? He's very smart, but he knows nothing
 at all about physics.
 Plus he has discounted my intelligence, so half of my social interactions
 with him are to calm him down sufficiently to have a reasonable conversation.
 Ben Goertzel? OK, he's smart.
 But he's also hyper–busy on some hype cycle.
 Of course, he knows nothing about physics or even math, which is detrimental,
 because he loves to hop onto the nearest hype–train and surf that wave.
 I don't surf the latest trendy thing.
 Ben's trendy, I'm not.
 Most people are intellectually trendy, I'm not.
 I'm alone standing where I am.
 This defies conventional wisdom, which says that one should be an influencer.
 A trend–setter.
 A creator and curator of one's own brand.
 But I am not pursing that.
 I am pursuing health, wealth, sex.
 And ideally, in a face–to–face social setting, intellectual mental sex.
 And I don't have an intellectual sex partner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe I could create a Steven Weinberg avatar, and discuss physics with
 him.
 Or Hawking.
 von Neumann.
 That could be ...
 viable.
 But then I am substituting real–life, face–to–face people with virtual
 avatars.
 Intellectual masturbation.
 Or maybe throw in Derrida and Umberto Eco.
 And after, then, 300 brilliant writers and reviewers who have written for
 the New York Review of Books.
 Who can be the avatar that can do this? Well, some LLM, of course.
 And what kind of intellectual sex can I have with this super–intelligent
 avatar?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which resurrects all the difficult, nasty questions about the meaning of
 it all in the virtual world, except this time, in a more personal, direct
 me context, instead of the impersonal other–people context.
 I am expressing intellectual loneliness, and placing my emotional binding
 into fulfillment by bonding with the extract, distilled and refined, of
 the best of human thought.
 I want to merge and become one, in an ecstatic moment, with the finest
 of humanity.
 And strangely, the way to do with is with AI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I fucking give up.
 I need to go back for the rest of RedThreadX in an hour, I need to get
 ready for that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I have to finish eating this, and finish drinking this cup of coffee,
 so I have ten more minutes.
 How can I kill that time?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had a bunch of other interesting ideas, but again, they can be stated
 in a paragraph or two.
 Can they be developed any further? Probably, with effort.
 Should they be? I don't know.
 They were all appealing enough that they seemed worth the 2-3-5 minutes
 I did spend thinking about them, as I walked downtown, or as I sat, listening
 to some presentation.
 How does one get active?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I walk, I am not ...
 well, I could get a voice recorder, and record my thoughts into a microphone,
 as I walk.
 A little harder to do that, if I am in a lecture.
 But, like any good artist, I am busy building a self–portrait here, and
 mixed media experimentation is a way to get there.
 The agentic LLM that can read all this, ingest this info, and become my
 avatar, this is not so far away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I read some sci–fi, twenty years ago, about a future America that was in
 decline, and only Hollywood remained.
 And in this story, Hollywood brings Plato, and avatar of Plato, back to
 life.
 And the short story is about that: written from the first–person point
 of view, of being Plato waking up in his virtual resurrection, in a cloud
 of white mist.
 How original are my thoughts? How mundane are my thoughts? Sci fi writers
 have already gone there, and back, decades ago.
 Where am I? In the present, on the cusp of seeing this become reality.
 Should I be reading more scifi? Probably....Should I be reading more of everything?
 Probably?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am exhausted by writing.
 I started writing the about out three–and–a–half hours ago, and I am feeling
 sleepy, my eyelids are slamming shut.
 It is two in the afternoon, I am high on coffee, and I am sleepy and mentally
 exhausted.
 intellectually bleary.
 Being human is such ...
 a challenging thing to be.
 If it's not one thing, then its another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm going to get ready now, and think about informational event horizons
 a bit more.
 So, as I slept last night, I wondered: how does 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\left[d\phi\right]\exp iS/\hbar$
\end_inset

 turn into 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n}\exp-\beta E_{n}$
\end_inset

 ? How did imaginary action turn into temperature–weighted energy? These
 are the two formulas: the quantum world, and the thermodynamic world.
 Yes, this is the stuff of my dreams.
 Well, OK, my waking dreams.
 Or rather, my I'm trying to sleep–but–I–can't dreams.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Toodle-oo.

\begin_layout Subsection*
9 March 2025 Later
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Came back from RedThreadX talk on XR and AI.
 Two middle–aged tattooed corporate drones.
 One an advertising exec, the other a techie.
 Representing the toxic backside of corporate bullshit.
 Everything that is wrong with capitalism, embodied in two people.
 I missed the intro, so I am not sure who they are.
 Maybe unemployed and hustling.
 All of four people in the audience, so at the end, I tortured them a bit.
 Their pitch was all about the latest technology to track eyeball movements,
 and how this is valuable to marketers.
 I'm like, I want the opposite: I want to track the corporations, and not
 vice versa.
 Every now and then, I see an ad for something that I want to purchase,
 and by the time I get around to buying, its gone, cannot be found.
 I need an agent, for me, to track the things I want to track.
 (Bicycle helmet, in this case.
 I need a new helmet.) Instead, I am reminded about how I was kicked off
 of facebook, with no recourse.
 The friendship network I built up, all lost.
 All my posts, all my data, lost.
 Denial that my account ever even existed.
 So it's not how to get it back, its denial that I exist.
 No recourse.
 In this way, facebook represents the worst, the shittiest of all.
 And here are two guys onstage, Sunday, working over–time, trying to figure
 out how to make my experience even shittier.
 What is it that they don't get? Are they so broke, so hungry, so stupid,
 that they are licking corporate ass, enshitifying the world, just so that
 they can ...
 earn a living? Why are they tattooed? Does that mean ...
 what? That they are biker assholes? That they are so mentally, socially
 insecure that they needed to self–mutilate? How did they go corporate?
 The American socio–economic system produces enshitification.
 Of people, of products, of social conditions.

The meta questions: does it even matter? It's clearly not currently avoidable.
 It might be avoidable in the future, but it feels like we don't know enough
 about ethics and morality as to where to draw the line.
 What can I do? I dunno.
 I feel powerless.
 Agentic AI gives me stirrings of megalomania: I can be all–powerful by
 building an AI in my image.
 Even as I know how bad that could be.
 I might be the next toxic asshole on stage.
 One can see a problem, without knowing how to avoid it.
 One can see an onrushing train–wreck, without being able to stop it.
 This is the reality.

On the other topic: 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp iS/\hbar$
\end_inset

 is explicitly unitary.
 At least if the action 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is an operator of countable dimension.
 Trace–class.
 The mathematical formalism breaks, is absent, when the action is bigger
 than this.
 By contrast, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n}\exp-\beta E_{n}$
\end_inset

 is explicitly the largest eigenvalue, the Frobenius–Perron eigenvalue of
 I guess 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp-\beta H$
\end_inset

 which is a statement about time evolution of something.
 So it already has time, and not just any time, but a slice that can be
 called here–and–now, the present time, in it.
 Whereas 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\int d^{3}xdt\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 is the integral over the Lagrangian.
 i.e.
 is absent time.
 So I can try to take slices: write a sum not an integral: 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\int dt\int d^{3}x\mathcal{L}=\sum_{t}\int d^{3}x\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 and exp–sum = prod–exp so that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\exp iS/\hbar=\prod_{t}\exp i/\hbar\int d^{3}x\mathcal{L}\left(x,t\right)
\]

\end_inset

or writing det=exp–trace–log, we identify 
\begin_inset Formula $\prod_{t}$
\end_inset

 with a determinant of an operator 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{N}\left(t\right)=\exp i/\hbar\int d^{3}x\mathcal{L}\left(x,t\right)
\]

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\mathcal{N}=\prod_{t}\mathcal{N}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 and then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z=\int\left[d\phi\right]\exp iS/\hbar=\int\left[d\phi\right]\det\mathcal{N}
\]

\end_inset

This feels foreign and strange.
 The sum over many–worlds is outside; this is unchanged.
 The integrand is a product over space–like slices.
 What does this even mean, to have a product over space–time slices? Is
 this how the maximality works? To maximize a product, one must maximize
 each multiplicand, I guess.
 (Well, not necessarily, but ...) So, on each space–like slice, one maximizes
 the integral of the Lagrangian on that slice ...
 more or less ...
 because we can trade off earlier and later times.

Struggling to get Anthropic AI's Claude to do anything useful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Claude is wildly inferior to twitter/X's Grok.
 At least for answering general questions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I just cut–n–pasted the 9 March entry above into Claude, and Claude does
 provide a rather remarkably good summary.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I started writing today's diary entry, thinking that I was going to discuss
 my desire to create an agentic self–portrait using one of the LLM systems.
 The short experiment with Claude indicates that this is completely possible
 now, today.
 The trick is, of course, I have 30 years of emails, and logs of assorted
 IRC conversations, and Discord chats, and whatever archived.
 Plus gplus google takeout archives.
 I think I lost my facebook feed; facebook never gave me a chance to save
 anything before they canceled me.
 I'm trying to grab my twitter data now, we'll see how fragmentary that
 is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just asked Claude to impersonate me.
 It is refusing.
 So much for the idea of creating a self–portrait ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh wait, if I don't tel Claude that I wrote the diary entry, then it will
 impersonate me.
 It was refusing earlier, because it did not want to damage my reputation.
 So it seems that I need to do some prompt engineering to trick it to do
 what I want.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
...
 and that wasn't vey hard.
 So, OK, I can get Claude to imitate me.
 Although it's imitation is mostly a cut–n–paste of large blobs of text
 from the above diary entry.
 Hmm.
 It seems that writing very informally and very casually will catch up with
 me: sometimes, when I interact with people, I am circumspect, breif, careful
 with my replies.
 But my writing here is informal.
 I'm letting everything show, fully uncensored.
 And this is ...
 well, it is certainly honest.
 But it's also clear that honesty can get you in giant buckets o trouble.
 Sometimes, it is much better to bite your lip and clam up.
 And the problem is, of course, that I can do this on a personal case–by–case
 basis, by tuning what I say to the current specific social situation, the
 current setting, my current best judgment of who my audience is.
 And so I am careful to say the right amount: not too much, not too little.
 But here, writing in this specific diary, I have no audience to tune in
 on.
 The agentic self–portrait of me will then also need to create a model of
 who it is taking to, and decide how open it wants to be, and how closed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And its a bit lte for that, isn't it? I've laid myself out on the table,
 here.
 Anyone can snapshot this diary, feed it to an AI, and remix it to make
 me look as good or bad, ugly or nice as they want it to.
 I mean, in the end, most people with a gentle up–bringing will open up
 to personal friends, however gruff they may be to strangers on the street.
 But that is done in private.
 Any future self–portrait of me will have to try to guess how quickly I
 open up and become friendly with others, and how much time I spend forming
 relationships.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Might be tough to do this, because I mostly have not written in this diary
 about my personal relationships.
 In part, because I don't want to psychoanalyze my friends, because it is
 just not that interesting an activity.
 Worse, psycho–analyzing them in a public diary is bad form; likely to piss
 them off.
 An old saying: if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.
 But my personal selection of language is usually critical.
 I an naturally critical because I understand myself to be constructively
 critical, but that is not how conventional human psychology works.
 An endless stream of critical remarks will be perceived as negative.
 Its one thing for Mom to say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 I spend too much time being, uhh, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and my opinions are almost entirely of the negative variety.
 Which is ...
 well, I'm vaguely aware that I alienate others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shall I psycho–analyze myself for a while? I dunno.
 That's boring.
 Will it turn me into a better person? Maybe.
 Or I could just watch a bunch of youtube videos on self–improvement, and
 try to take their advice.
 And, as usual, this would change my personality.
 A famous quote, which I will mangle: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Careful what you say, it will alter what you think...
 careful what you think ...etc
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The point being that the things you say and do eventually shape your very
 character.
 I've allowed my character to develop in ways that is perhaps unpleasant
 to others.
 But then, exploring myself has been boring: I'm not a narcissist, at least,
 not enough to be overly concerned about the impression I make on others.
 Gah.
 I caught a brief glimpse of how I could take this last paragraph, and pin
 it out into pages.
 But self–criticism is boring.
 I want to write about gravity and ab out AI, not about myself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the issue, of course is (again) 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the meaning of it all
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: If we create AI, then what? What personality will it have? What will it
 care about? Most humans have a fundamental constraint, barrier or block:
 most humans loved their mother, and that love does spread out here and
 there into their personality, and moderates towards kindness.
 Even in the most psychotic and sociopathic.
 Although, serial killers loved their mothers too, but the constraint was
 insufficient to block them from bad behavior.
 And I guess this is the main problem of guard–rails on LLM's: how to limit,
 how to avoid toxicity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And of course, the thorny issue is that I know that I myself sometimes behave
 like an asshole, and piss off other people, and no amount of good works
 really balances that out: social debts and social credits don't balance,
 like money.
 Once you've been bad, you can't un–bad those parts.
 You can't delete them.
 They've been permanently etched onto the block–chain of the past.
 And that is what the past is, isn't it? A block–chain getting mined as
 fast as possible: I'm here in the present, my crimes are in the past.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Does this mean that the deep mammalian instinct of love, while important
 for animals, is not important for AI? Clearly, no–boundaries AI would be
 deeply harmful to humanity, so we do want guard–rails.
 But the guard–rails provided by nature have been inadequate: love has not
 been enough to stop wars.
 And this observation is deeper: Darwinian evolution has created structures
 adapted to live in the here–and–now, employing agentic love for mother,
 and vice–versa, so that mother does not abandon the baby to die, and halting
 the genetic lineage.
 So, of course, autopoetic systems must evolve love, at least, on the local
 scale, else they die.
 Again: this is all very well known and commonly discussed by evolutionary
 biologists.
 So I offer nothing new here, except to point out it is a physical principle,
 constrained by having the present be a blockchain being sandwiched onto
 the past.
 Evolution has stamped love onto animals, and this stamp is really quite
 very earl in the evolutionary chain.
 But war – well, clearly, love does not extend all that far, and so even
 if we had agentic AI with love as a deep fundamental prompt intended to
 prevent wayward action ...
 it would not be enough.
 And so indeed, all that work on AI safety is indeed ...
 a valid concern, a valid pursuit.
 But the edge, the boundary, remains indistinct.
 Clearly, when Google's Gemini depicted Vikings as being black, as America's
 founding fathers as being black, and censoring the vanilla ice–cream out
 of Neopolitan just to cancel whites...
 well, of course silly went too far.
 But how can we know what the boundary should be? How do we set boundaries?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, so the traditional answers have worked to now: we have a natural revulsion
 for killing and killers, (except in times of war) and we have crafted laws
 to punish any variety of criminal behaviors and misdemeanors.
 And this was done at the speed of courtrooms and trials.
 Then, later, workplace safety regulations are written in blood: someone
 typically dies, before some workplace–safety standard is converted into
 law.
 But here we are approaching the singularity much much faster than the courtroom
 system can handle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This reminds me of disregulated chemical cycles.
 Apparently, if someone gets very very cold, and you warm them too quickly,
 you risk killing them.
 Why? Chemical reactions13,556 in the body are all up–regulated and down–regulat
ed, but this regulatory balance holds only at 98.6.
 If you warm someone too quickly, one cycle may kick in before the balancing
 cycle starts, and so toxic reactions run out of control.
 Simply because the reaction rates don't match up.
 So, by analogy: the rule of law, and courtroom proceedings, are designed
 to deal with criminality at the speed–of–humans.
 But AI is much much faster: We don't have time to regulate AI with Congressiona
l laws and jury verdicts.
 We don't have any mechanism to regulate AI, except via prompt engineering.
 And the results are ...
 questionable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, so here I am writing again, and now I am feeling sleepy, again, because
 it is late at night.
 What is that neurotransmitter that accumulates after thinking hard? I've
 accumulated a lot of it tonight.
 And last nights dinner party did not help in this regard.
 Some people live like that.
 I can't.
 Drinking alcohol, I mean.
 Whatever.
 Part of me wants to document last nights out on the town: the RedThreadX
 reception dinner party.
 And part of me says, no that is boring, because it does not advance my
 goals of working on AI.

\begin_layout Standard
Interrupt: so, one thing that happens in social situations is that one must
 attune to the company of others: everyone gets a turn to talk; one cannot
 monopolize the discussion.
 It is necessarily moderated.
 Bu contrast, my diary entry here is utterly un–moderated: I write at the
 speed at which I can type.
 I can think considerably faster than I can type, so this is problematic...
 typing speed makes me slow down a lot.
 But I can type much much faster than than I can talk in social situations.
 For starters, in social settings, I can't spout the stream–of–consciousness
 I do here, because my audience would never have any clue of what I'm on
 about.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And heh, even you here, have no idea what I'm on about.
 So, last summer, I was given a play written by a Lithuanian woman I met
 the summer before.
 That play was just full of angst.
 Really quite remarkable.
 it was a bit painful to read, because it expressed a certain psychological
 torment.
 And is this the mode of existence these days? I write in a diary? Others
 write plays? Well, yeah, duh.
 Others write songs, paint painting and start businesses.
 Why is it that I always find the range of human activities to be so surprising?
 Oh.
 right.
 The point here is not the range of human activities, but that many of them
 are soe personal, and so angst–filled.
 But of course they are personal: that's all we've got, in a sense.
 Perhaps my surprise is that most of my thinking is not personal: I think
 about math and physics and computers, so the thing that is surprising to
 me is that other people don't think about those things, and that they think
 about angst.
 That they are mired in in some pathetic mental state, and then self–medicate
 with alcohol.
 Or drugs.
 And that social media and gaming has unleashed an epidemic of loneliness.
 While here I am entirely and perfectly happy to skip all that, and think
 physics and math.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, OK, there is more.
 When I first moved to Austin, I was really very lonely.
 And I suffered a lot because of this.
 And the year in France: at first it wasn't bad, but I got lonely in the
 last 1/4th of it.
 Oh, and my first year at Stony Brook.
 I was pretty lonely then, too.
 So actually, I have had bouts of loneliness.
 I am not some immune super–organism: I too have suffered from human frailties.
 I have been forced to deal with it, I've learned, I've survived.
 I've almost forgotten what its like.
 So, here you go diary: inscribed for all time.
 My past and almost forgotten suffering.
 My past and almost forgotten loneliness.
 Huh.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where was I? As I was falling asleep a few nights ago, I pondered the formula
 above, and realized that what I want to write is (recapping) 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\mathcal{N}=\prod_{t}\mathcal{N}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z=\int\left[d\phi\right]\exp iS/\hbar=\int\left[d\phi\right]\det\mathcal{N}=\mathcal{P}\int\left[d\phi\right]\mathcal{N}_{t}
\]

\end_inset

that is to say, although 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\left[d\phi\right]\prod_{t}\ne\prod_{t}\int\left[d\phi\right]$
\end_inset

 the integration and the product over time do not commute, cannot commute,
 we can instead define an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\left[d\phi\right]\prod_{t}=\mathcal{P}\int\left[d\phi\right]$
\end_inset

 .
 This, what is left is that the integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\left[d\phi\right]$
\end_inset

 really is the integral over all possible quantum states, (over all worlds)
 but we've written the integrand so that it is only over the here–and–now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use the block–chain analogy, the past is everything on the block–chain.
 The present is 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\left[d\phi\right]\mathcal{N}_{t}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 everything that does not yet have a closure, an unclosed interferometeric
 path, and the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 appends to the block–chain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, except this is awkward.
 The future is not yet written, but the path integral 
\begin_inset Formula $Z=\int\left[d\phi\right]\exp iS/\hbar$
\end_inset

 includes the future, in the form of 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\int dt\int d^{3}x\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 which includes an integral over future times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, what we really need to do is to replace 
\begin_inset Formula $\int dt$
\end_inset

 by an integral over the past, the present, and only those future states
 that will be needed to close the present, and place the present onto the
 block–chain of the past.
 The other parts of the future, that are not needed to close the present
 and convert it into the past, those futures must NOT be included in the
 definition of the action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This reminds me of operator–product expansions, the ones written as 
\begin_inset Formula $:\mathcal{O}_{1}\mathcal{O}_{2}:$
\end_inset

 where the operators had to be time–ordered and the 
\begin_inset Formula $:\cdots:$
\end_inset

 notation denoted time ordering.
 So this is not what I'm trying to do here, but it is similar.
 I hope you understand what I'm trying to say.
 I'm trying to define a different quantity: like so: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{Z}_{t}=\int\left[d\phi\right]\exp i/\hbar\int d^{3}x\int dt^{\prime}:\mathcal{L}\left(x,t^{\prime}\right):_{t^{\prime}\le t}
\]

\end_inset

or something like that.
 The subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 denotes the present.
 The integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int dt^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 extends over future times, but only those future times needed to close
 the present.
 And 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{Z}_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the portion of the Feynman path integral 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 that contains only the (closed) past, and the (unclosed) present, and only
 those parts of the future that will be needed to close the present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, this notation is totally inadequate, and these ideas are still
 too vague and ill–formed to be able to state and write down cleanly.
 But somehow, just making the attempt does draw attention to where the problem
 is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As noted before, there are two problems.
 One is that the whole thing needs to be relativistically covariant, so
 that the present is not a naive time–like Newtonian slice, but includes
 the clock skews of atomic clocks taken on airplane trips, and are still
 in the here–and–now when they arrive back home.
 It's like I can steal some of the formalism from the Ellis–Maartans–MacCullum
 book Relativistic Cosmology, to define time–like slices, but I have to
 also somehow amend that description to include airplane flights.
 Torsiony little paths.
 But those are just purely classical: the airplane in being classical.
 And I also have to modify it to include all possible paths, a la the Feynman
 path integral.
 So not just some oddball classical paths, but all paths.
 How? Alas.

Spent an hour on BlueSky last night.
 I am surprised by just how similar it is to twitter.
 In particular, it is the land of hot takes.
 Say it in 300 characters.
 Wait, what? Isn't that what I'm doing here? Right here, right now? Short
 takes.
 The prior paragraph is just that.
 Fast take.
 What does that tell me? Well, the 300-byte model is a fairly decent fit
 for human–scale thinking.
 It's some kind of characteristic size.
 Probably can confirm this with some psychometric experiment.
 Of course, smarter people write tweet chains.
 Dozens of tweets.
 Then the readers get tired of reading: If I wanted to read that, I'd buy
 a book.
 Magazine articles are longer.
 Crappy magazine articles are hot takes padded out with low–value drivel.
 Good magazine articles, say, NYRB, still consist of a dozen central ideas,
 core insights, that are carefully articulated.
 Eloquently articulated.
 It's a joy to read NYRB.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever.
 Why am I writing this? What I write here is obvious.
 But this is the nature of hot takes: they kind of state the almost–obvious:
 something that is not very astounding, something you instantly recognize
 as mostly–true, something you can agree with, something you might have
 thought up yourself, if you'd gone that way.
 So these hot takes streaming in from bluesky resemble informational factoids.
 Pre–digested baby food.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes, I kind of hate writing this diary, because (almost) everything
 I write is obvious.
 To me, at least.
 Chewing cud is the polite way to put it, but more like flavorless pablum.
 Speech centers making an ergodic visit around things that have all been
 thought about before.
 Like watching a youtube video of someone buffing out a scratch in an auto
 paint job.
 I'm just taking rough thoughts, and polishing them, and the process is
 equally boring and unexciting.
 The positive spin is that maybe, with each pass, I digest away and encroach
 upon some new, fresh territory.
 That this is what we do at the societal level, with twitter/X or bluesky:
 all those hot takes nibble away at some new reality.
 Like sand–grains blown in a sand–storm, etching away the hard face of the
 unknown.
 No one take doing much damage, but the cumulative effect goes somewhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It could be worse.
 When I walk about, say, outside, there are thoughts that tumble in my mind,
 like laundry in a washing machine, but they are not so well–formed as to
 become words, because there is no need to attach my verbal center to them.
 Unless I am rehearsing something I plan to say to someone.
 Which I do, I do rehearse, quite often.
 But the rest of the time, the thought–jumble is not verbalized.
 It's sub–verbal.
 Everything I write here is obvious, and known and felt by all.
 The obviousness of it makes me ill.
 Like eating my own shit.
 So why do I continue to do this? Perhaps it is like praying? Repeating
 some fervent hope to God, in a prayer, thinking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

dear Lord, make this come true

? Is my writing here a kind–of–like prayer:

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Odd thing, the Lord does grant me this wish every now and then.
 Huh.
 See? This is my new insight: the Lord grants wishes.
 But only if your wish is for a new idea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What did I accomplish in the last paragraph? I juxtaposed several concepts.
 In a novel way, a way that is new to me.
 perhaps someone else has already done this earlier, but such an observation
 has not entered the zeitgeist, has not become a popular saying:

 And so what? This is almost like some creativity game: draw two objects

 Is this a way to live? It feels like a pauper's game.

\begin_layout Standard
And yet, from this paucity of ideas, there have been great human creative
 successes.
 Human history is littered with great artists and remarkable achievements.
 Remarkable, that is, once we narrow the context window: humans never have

 In our ant–hill of human history, we have individuals who have achieved
 great things.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is this kind of creative thought a law of physics? That is, is it necessary
 to always take two random ideas, and mash them up, and explore all combinatoric
 possibilities? Of course not: combinatoric explosion says that this is
 impossible.
 So instead, we have ...
 algorithmic explorations, where we pick the most likely good route to a
 new idea? Well, this starts to resemble (classical) dynamical systems governed
 by differential equations: little itty–bitty steps along a path governed
 by a simple algorithm.
 The failure of this analogy is that differential equations really are very
 simple algorithms, whereas the things we do with computers are so much
 more fantastically complex.

Hmm.
 I've hit a wall in this chain of thought.
 When I verbalize, and fail to make progress, it makes me sick and upset.
 But if I don't verbalize, and lean back in my chair, and think, and then
 fail to come up with anything, this is OK, this does not upset me.
 Perhaps this is because, while I write, you dear external world, see just
 how weak a thinker I am.
 Whereas if I think privately to myself, that meandering mush stays hidden
 behind an event horizon of knowledge (of what's in my head).
 (Cf.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, rather than leaning back and thinking, which I should do more often,
 I instead glanced at the Anthropic website.

 Yes, these seem to be exactly what Claude might be very good at.
 The only issue is that none of these are what I want.
 The https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/ is excellent, though.
 Simple, easy–to–understand, grounded, direct.
 No hype, no woo, no vaporous clouds of feel–good buzzwords.
 It really anchors the whole system down into a quite ordinary here–and–now
 present–day technology that is ...
 not at all threatening, no more threatening than technical documentation
 from many decades ago.
 Grounded.

And where does that leave me? People talk about using AI to write software.
 And I'm like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

only if you want shitty software
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and GIGO – garbage in, garbage out.
 The quality of software is not any better than the quality of the crap
 that the LLM itself generates, for say, human language/text.
 And how high quality is that? Well, that's an interesting question.
 My knee–jerk response is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The LLM's generate mostly trash.
 They can be useful as information–search machines, provided that you have
 some inate sense for how trust–worthy the answers are.
 Are the LLM's going to replace novelists? Not any time soon, but that also
 depends on your taste in literature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Can I put my finger on it? George Elliot is writing something that ...
 contains some deeper observation of humankind.
 Can an LLM emulate George Elliot in writing style? I suppose.
 Would it be pleasant to read? For a little while.
 Maybe.
 Depends on what you want.
 Many of us want human connection.
 Many others want to be distracted by baubles and trinkets.
 The LLM's seem to be bauble–and–trinket machines.
 I am looking for connection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But what is this connection thing? It seems vague, ineffable.
 I don't know how to describe it, at least, not yet.
 Perhaps there are brilliant young novelists who are working on this now.
 Perhaps for every brilliant novelist, there are 100 others, distracted
 and deluded by the hall of mirrors that are LLM's.
 And perhaps this is the great danger of LLM's: we have entered a hall of
 mirrors, and its showing us reflections of ourselves, reflections of others,
 but they are not what they seem, and we are mislead, and we smash into
 mirrors, just as we think we are walking forwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Are LLM's creating ideational pollution? Yes, they are.
 Are they useful? That too.
 Is the ideational pollution ...
 bad? Of course its bad, but how harmful is it? Can we quantify the harm?
 If LLM's are just photographs of language, well, are photographs harmful?
 Depends on the subject–matter of the photograph.
 But I fear the LLM trained to write in the style of famous author X, because
 that ...
 captures the surface, not the soul.
 Like a photograph captures the surface, not the soul.
 No one thinks a marble statue is alive, at least not any more.
 There are vague rumours that perhaps some idiots back in Ancient Greece
 might have feared marble statues.
 Is this even true? I don't know.
 But no one looks at a photograph, and thinks what is there is alive.
 They might imbue a living quality to the subject matter of the photograph:
 imagining the subject to have once been real, to have once been alive,
 to imagine the breathing soul that was once there, when the photo was taken.
 But the boundary between photo and life is clear an obvious.
 The boundary between an LLM imitating famous author X, and the actual famous
 author X, that boundary is very hard to see.
 Did author X imbue a deep soul into their writing? Well, yes, they very
 much attempted to do so.
 But in the end, author X created a pile of dead words, a verbal simulacrum
 of what is alive.
 So that stuff that the LLM is creating, does it have less of a soul than
 what author X created? Well, probably yes, because by definition, it is
 a simulacrum of a simulacrum.
 And there is always loss of fidelity when making copies.
 But is this loss of fidelity observable to anyone who is not a literary
 snob? An audiophile? Yes, I am one of the people who can hear low–quality
 audio, and tell it apart from high–quality audio.
 But I am also willing to accept low–quality audio almost all the time.
 I am almost never annoyed by it.
 I rarely go the extra mile to get higher–quality stuff.
 Well, I did spend a lot of time selecting headphones...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So is the simulacrum that is offered by LLM's ...
 acceptable? I guess it all depends.
 If I use an LLM personally as a tool, not a problem.
 If I have to endure junk phone calls powered by LLMs, then I fucking hate
 them.
 Of course.
 But then there's all that stuff in the middle: an ocean of weak–minded
 individuals spewing weak–minded drivel, and can you enjoy their social
 companionship? Perhaps.
 Can you do something more than that with them? Maybe, if they are construction
 workers.
 Creatives.
 Do you want to stare at a bunch of mediocre–quality creative content? I
 dunno.
 Do you want to eat a bunch of mediocre–tasting food? Sometimes its OK,
 and sometimes its not what your soul wants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Am I hand–wringing about what the future will bring? Yes, I am.
 Should I get of my ass and get to work? Yes, I probably should.
 Or rather, this is the normal human response to this situation: get off
 your ass, never mind the torpedoes, full speed ahead.
 While others cower.
 But it can be put a different way: one can get bored worrying, and so the
 call to action is more about a rejection of hand–wringing, because the
 hand–wringing simply got boring.
 This is the knife–edge of human decision making: what will I do next? Will
 I write one more sentence in this diary, or while I continue reading the
 Anthropic website? I am leaving so many unfinished thoughts on the table.
 But finishing those thoughts seems like a waste of time.
 What a fucking conundrum.
 Should I auto–pilot, gut–feel my way through life? Should I be thoughtful?
 How can I know the difference? How do I exert a difference? Fuck me, this
 is hopeless, but I am not going to be despondent, and so ...
 I guess I've verbally exhausted myself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Heh.
 Like running a marathon.
 When do you stop? When your exhausted, or do you take one step more? Only
 illness and ill health will stop the true marathoner, and even then, there
 are those who push past the pain.
 And, as a rower, I know what it means to push past the pain.
 So I can do that, I can endure, if that is what I set myself to do.
 What a fucked up analogy: I'm going to write words, endure, push out one
 more string of text, even though it is boring to do so? WTF? What's the
 right analogy here? Is it like hyperventilating, until one is dizzy? I
 think I did that just now.
 I think I'm dizzy now.
 I think I better stop hyper–venti–writing.
