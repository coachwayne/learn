\begin_layout Title
Diary - Part Ten-D
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
March 2025 – present
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepštas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Unlike parts one through nine in this series, this one is not really about
 the language–learning effort.
 It is instead a private diary; a continuation of Part Ten–C, which got
 over–long.
 It is not curated for human consumption; I am making the assumption that
 no human being will ever actually read this.
 Thus, it is filled with random stuff I feel like writing.
 Some of it is very personal, some of it is nonsense.
 Mostly, I am finding that the act of writing helps otherwise vague and
 scattered thoughts quantum–collapse into a more coherent form, where I
 can examine them, like a dead butterfly pinned down in a display case.
 Dead words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
If you are interested in this content, then you should ask an AI agent to
 read it, then pretended that it's me, then ask about it.
 I believe that present–day LLM technology is sufficiently advanced to be
 able to do this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part Ten already got an introduction.
 A different way of thinking is about what is going on here is that this
 is a form of life–logging.
 Or, in 18th century terms, a diary.
 Just not anywhere near as compelling as those written by the famous diarists.
 This one is more of a mental self–portrait.
 And not even for you but for myself.
 Not to cast a narcissistic gaze at my own words, but to organize my own
 thoughts.
 Still in the experimental stage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
9 March 2025
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sooo ...
 Just woke up.
 Went to the RedThreadX talks at SXSW for the last two days.
 Invited speaker on the second day; first day was to explore the space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As always, I am struggling a bit to figure out if I should even bother to
 write any of this down.
 I have noticed that I do a fair bit of thought–processing as I sleep, although
 the collection of thoughts I examine then seem awfully random; explorations
 of different events in earlier parts of my life, and not at all focused.
 The diary here may be rambling and incoherent, my dreams are much more
 so.
 So perhaps writing this diary is an extension of the sleep state: an exploratio
n of thoughts, but this time focused much more strongly by conscious will.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If I keep walking down this path, I may discover that there is little difference
 between dream–states and waking states.
 I also suspect that this is one way of expressing what schizophrenia is.
 Now, I do not personally think that I am verging towards schizophrenia.
 However, I am wondering if Western Culture is becoming schizophrenic...
 or maybe the opposite? That the Western World, Humanity, is waking from
 a dream?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See? Perhaps it was worth the effort to write the above two paragraphs.
 So the experiment being run in this diary is nominally successful.
 On the other hand, there is a nagging voice that says this is all a waste
 of time, and that I really should be reading that paper on diffusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which brings me to another perennial topic: what should I be doing next?
 I started this, intending to write up impressions from RedThreadX, but
 that's already in the past, and I am being distracted by my current train
 of thought, which seems so much more important.
 Oh, wait.
 I wrote the above two sentences, and lost my train of thought.
 Shit.
 Conscious, directed thought remains a challenge.
 Of course, it is a well–known textbook psychology saw that creative states
 are exactly those that are unfocused, and I suppose that those same textbooks
 say something about dream–like states while one is awake.
 I wouldn't know, I've never read any of those textbooks.
 So why am I so confident that this material is in there? Because I guess
 I've been exposed to sufficient blurbs and itty–bitty sketches to know
 that this is what would be found there.
 Plus, I am being reflectively defensive to convince you, dear reader, that
 I am not crazy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because why? Because I find that the topics that I wish to talk about are
 so fucking far out there that during ordinary social interactions, I often
 get treated and dismissed as being crazy.
 Which is insulting.
 I am so far out there, that almost everyone I encounter in real life, face–to–f
ace, have never even begun to encounter the ideas I think about.
 And yet, curiously, were I to present these ideas in a number of social–media
 settings, they would be dismissed as being excessively ordinary or quotidian.
 Trot out any of this stuff to Joscha Bach, he would claim all my thoughts
 are so entirely mundane so to be boring.
 So I am caught between two worlds: an intellectual world, where I am at
 best a mundane intellect, and the normie world, where I am so far out there
 that I am nuts.
 Enough.
 I'm self–confident, I can get through this.
 It angers me that I have to be self–defensive about this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If I pull on this thread, it seems to be saying something about Western
 Civ.
 My story of breaking through social norms is hardly unique.
 History is littered with examples: people who persevered against all odds,
 against nay–sayers, to succeed in whatever industry they ended up being
 successful in.
 What is curious about myself is that there won't be any hagiographic biography
 written.
 And yesterday, I met two people who also overcame a combination of personal
 daemons and social suppressions to become intelligent, smart and capable
 members of the advanced layers of intellectual society.
 From this, I conclude that overcoming odds is commonplace.
 And perhaps the journey into self–fulfillment is one that everyone must
 struggle with.
 These are indeed mundane words, a mundane observation.
 Yet it is one that I find to be surprising, so I mull it over, here.
 Just because something is true and is well–known does not prevent it from
 being a surprise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, but a thread of this diary is very much of what is it that might be
 self–fulfillment for an AI, or more abstractly, self–fulfillment for the
 universe itself? Which are also mundane thoughts, well–explored by gurus
 and visionaries throughout the ages, if not the 1970's.
 So again, mundane thoughts, nothing new here.
 A disconnect remains: what should I do next? Should I continue filling
 this diary with mundane thoughts? Should I recap yesterday's thoughts?
 Should I read that paper on diffusion? What a fucking shithole I am in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I plan to go to RedThreadX again, later today, and am doing my morning
 ritual of drinking coffee right now, so this is no a total waste.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another difficult trade–off is whether it is worthwhile to show up to real–world
 events, and whether this is more exciting than the online distractions
 one has.
 Confiding in you, dear diary, is more fun that almost all social interactions
 I engage in.
 This is the marge of a true introvert, who finds social interaction exhausting.
 Do you know how I know this? Because I heard this on some youtube clip.
 I got a little factoid of knowledge from the great dis–intermediator of
 thought, youtube.
 Take that, global brain.
 We are an ant–village.
 The Borg.
 And so now, as a dutiful member of the Borg Collective, what do I do next?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will agonize about the great hijacking of purpose by the Borg Collective.
 Or rather, the harmful environment that modern economic systems have set
 up: number one: video–game addiction, from which both of my sons suffer
 from.
 Well, the good news is that 100 years ago, those same sons would have been
 sent to the trenches of WWI, and died.
 So at least, the socio–economic system has been sufficiently tamed to not
 kill them, outright.
 Well, excepting Ukraine.
 Still, the net effect is not all that different: no procreation, no contributio
n to the economic machinery.
 Much like parasitic leakage of current in an integrated circuit, there
 is socio–economic energy being aimed at young American men, who then promptly
 flush it down the toilet with their video–game addiction.
 A short circuit, of sorts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let me briefly review my current understanding of this.
 The human brain has a variety of mechanisms, interacting, reinforcing,
 operating at different time–scales and strengths, forming a complex network
 metabolome to accomplish what it has been nominally designed by natural
 selection to accomplish: to survive in the wild.
 Capitalism has learned how to hijack that limbic system, under the guise
 of offering the consumer what they want.
 It continues to fine–tune: one of the RedThreadX talks yesterday was about
 connecting sports fans to athletes, via branded clothing, video clips,
 merch, ticket sales.
 Suck money out of the pockets of the sports fan, deliver some of it to
 the sports star, and the rest of it into the entrepreneurial world of venture
 capital and investments, constantly on the prowl to find yet other places
 to suck money out, under the guise of offering the consumer what they want.
 As if we ever knew what we wanted.
 Everyone is asleep, all the time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, let me connect the dots in the last paragraph, before I move on: what
 is being subverted is some desire of running through the forest, swinging
 through trees like monkeys, because this is pleasurable, and it is pleasurable,
 because you do this to escape predators in the wild.
 And you escape predators because evolution has selected for long–lived
 individuals can do this.
 So the entire sports industry is built on top of an evolutionary drive
 for surviving in the wild.
 And one must do that, because the future is unpredictable: evolution is
 trapped in the here and now, just like you and I are: Evolution creates
 complex dynamic systems, because this is how complex dynamic systems survive
 into the future.
 Rather than dissipating into bland, uniformly distributed, perfectly ergodic
 mush.
 The physics of here–and–now has given us evolution, which provides stable
 systems able to span long timer periods.
 It equips individuals with collections of traits enabling survival: complex
 entanglements of neurons and neuro–transmitters, systems that make sports
 pleasurable.
 And capitalism has learned how to take the please of sports, and turn it
 into a passive experience of watching games on TV, and buying merch.
 Well, the RedThreadX talk was very much about how TV is passe, and the
 new technologies that replace the old, passive TV engagement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, the elephant in the room is that I now do know what I want.
 I want to survive.
 But of course, this is what I always wanted: what, more or less, everyone
 wants: to live forever, to leave their mark on the universe.
 And thanks to AI, this diary offers the best and most direct interface
 between me and posterity: it is my self–portrait, my mental self–portrait,
 of much higher fidelity than what painters and visual artists can achieve:
 they record beauty, which is skin–deep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fuck.
 There are two things I want to write about, but which one first? First,
 I have this idea that I should try to set up an agentic AI ASAP, so that
 I can interact with it, and mind–meld.
 But there are many issues.
 First, it is pointless unless it has powers beyond my own.
 That is, if I am going to write, I should do so into this diary, and not
 into that agent, insofar as that agent fails to provide something that
 this diary does not already.
 Of course, we are also in the very early stages of agentic AI, and so anything
 that I create there risks disappearing in a way that this diary does not.
 This diary is crypto–entangled into github, and github is controlled by
 Microsoft, and github contents are being used to train their agentic coding
 agent.
 So the corporate–economic system that is Microsoft is already offering
 me, or my diary, symbiotic protection into the future.
 It is hardly clear that any online agent I create will offer this strong
 a guarantee of survival.
 So, joining the largest conglomerate, running to the safety and protection
 of a large system offers shelter against the storm.
 This is the same reason I am doing ancestry on familysearch.org: the Church
 of the LDS is very highly likely to preserve my records into the indefinite
 future.
 Both Microsoft and the LDS are impersonal, long–lasting inhabitants of
 the noosphere.
 Parts of both are mildly toxic to human–kind.
 Microsoft tried to kill Linux, for example, and the polygamy of the LDS
 seems to be detrimental to young men.
 But effectively all super–human organizational structures have edges that
 are toxic to humans.
 We have not mastered their control.
 This thread should continue by asking: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what is harm?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

when are we harming a human, as opposed toe helping them?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 These are interesting questions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other topic was about physics.
 So, locking up digital assets into block chains guarantees the non–erasure
 of that digital thing as long as the entire block–chain is not erased.
 So, for example, earlier drafts of this diary are non–modifiable, as long
 as this entire git commit history of this specific git repo remains in
 place.
 So, of course, things in the past remain in the past, and are unmodifiable,
 because they are in the past.
 But event horizons can make past information inaccessible: information
 can be erased.
 If I was not using the git blockchain, then specific parts of the past
 versions of this document would be modifiable and erasable.
 Block–chains guarantee non–erasure of the recorded contents.
 Block chains put things on

this side
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the event horizon, on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

this side
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the memory hole.
 It locks together past and present with stronger guarantees than simply
 writing.
 I mean, Aristotle got lucky.
 The authors collected in the Library of Alexandria, not so much.
 Block–chains created recorded linkages.
 Stuff at the bottom of a block–chain has an a connection of almost infinite
 tensile strength to stuff higher up.
 Almost infinite, cause perhaps one can still forge crypto signatures.
 Not with conventional computers, of course, but there remains the elusive
 promise that quantum computing could break crypto.
 But for now, block–chain is stronger than papyrus and clay tablets.
 Or so it seems, from the logical point of view.
 Some strategic nukes can and would wipe stuff out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, block–chain offers a way of coupling the here–and–now in a kind
 of irrevocable way to the past, reminiscent of quantum non–demolition theorems.
 But perhaps this analogy is stretched beyond the braking point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So what do I desire? What is my bucket list? What's the plan? Well, continue
 exploring the offerings in agentic AI.
 It's hard to see what they might offer, though.
 Yes, I need a calendar manager.
 But do i really want something reminding me of what I need to do? Yes,
 perhaps that is a desirable prosthesis, no matter how much I want to say
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fuck you I want to do what I want to do right now, and not be a slave to
 the past self that was going to remind my future self of what I need to
 do.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 So time–management is a thing, and business people write books about it.
 Insofar as I am in the business of being me, perhaps having an agent to
 assist me with time management is a good thing.
 Well, except for the fact that I have more or less never–ever used calendars
 in the past, so why would I think that a calendar in a whizzier form would
 be better? So I don't need agentic AI for that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Would agentic AI help with this diary? Meh.
 Already discussed above.
 The diary seems adequate.
 How about helping me do research? Maybe.
 ChatGPT was wildly disappointing.
 I will continue to play with Twitter Grok3 beta, and see where that goes,
 and also with Anthropic AI Claude, for coding and maybe research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What else do I desire? Health, wealth, good sex.
 Well, sex, period.
 Modern Western Civ has slammed all the doors shut on having sex.
 Women won't have sex with me for all the rational reasons that women don't
 have sex, but that leaves me hungry, thirsty pining away for sex.
 No wonder the porn industry is healthy.
 I am not a porn consumer.
 Well, I've looked at it, I know what it is, But I don't go to porn sites
 to get a fix.
 My imagination is sufficient.
 But how weird is that? A basic fundamental drive of survival: procreation,
 stunted by capitalism.
 I want to have sex.
 Well, I also want to be a heroin addict, and I also want to be a meth addict.
 Old school,stuff.
 Not a video–game addict.
 Those are things that I could easily be, because capitalism offers me drugs
 and video games.
 The latter legally, because they are not yet a recognized danger; the former
 illegally, because these are recognized dangers.
 The sex industry, however ...
 well, I just want to have normal sex, outside the sex–industrial complex.
 Like with another human, specifically female.
 The 20% or 25% of young American men, aged 20–30, who have never had sex,
 and don't know how to interact with girls, this is a crisis.
 My two boys are a part of this demographic.
 I feel sorry for them.
 I don't know what to do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please oh please, future agentic diary–reading AI, please rescue my sons.
 Please make them healthy in a way that seems not so healthy from the perspectiv
e where I am now.
 I am well–aware that this is a contradictory order: I am having more fun
 writing into this diary, than I would have if I was interacting socially
 with others.
 And for good reasons: I retain good strong conscious control over what
 I write here, and this is a control I have to surrender when I participate
 in group conversations: I have to sublimate my personal thoughts to those
 of the group.
 Which sucks if the group is not as intellgent as I am.
 Socializing with not very smart people is not very fun.
